        "Biology": "American lobsters have a long life span. It’s difficult to determine their exact age because they shed their hard shell when they molt, leaving no evidence of age. But scientists believe some American lobsters may live to be 100 years old.They can weigh up to 44 pounds.Lobsters must periodically molt in order to grow, shedding their hard, external skeleton (shell) when they grow too large for it and forming a new one. They eat voraciously after they molt, often devouring their own recently vacated shells. Eating their shell replenishes lost calcium and helps harden their new shell.Lobsters molt about 20 to 25 times over a period of 5 to 8 years between the time they hatch and when they are able to reproduce and reach the minimum legal size to be harvested.Usually, lobsters mate after the females molt. Males deposit sperm in the soft-shelled females. The female stores the sperm internally for up to a year.Females can have 5,000 to more than 100,000 eggs, depending on their size. The eggs are fertilized as females release them on the underside of their tails, where they carry the eggs for 9 to 11 months.Egg-bearing females move inshore to hatch their eggs during late spring or early summer.The pelagic (free-swimming) larvae molt four times before they resemble adults and settle to the bottom.Lobsters are opportunistic feeders, feeding on whatever prey is most available, so their diet varies regionally.Larvae and postlarvae are carnivorous and eat zooplankton (tiny floating animals) during their first year.Adults are omnivorous, feeding on crabs, mollusks, worms, sea urchins, sea stars, fish, and macroalgae.In general, a variety of bottom-dwelling species feed on lobster, including fish, sharks, rays, skates, octopuses, and crabs. Young lobsters are especially vulnerable to predators. Large, hard-shelled lobsters may be immune to predators (except humans).",

Each state, and NOAA Fisheries, has one vote when deliberating management measures for American lobster. The management board looks to industry advisors to provide recommendations for managing the fishery to meet management objectives.States have jurisdiction for implementing measures in state waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore), while <a href=\"https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/species/lobster/\">NOAA Fisheries</a> implements complementary regulations for the American lobster fishery in offshore federal waters (3 to 200 nautical miles from shore).The American lobster’s range is divided into <a href=\"http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/58f8cd9aLobsterManagement_StockArea_Map_Nov2016.JPG\">two stock areas and seven management areas</a>. There are seven Lobster Conservation Management Teams, one for each management area. These teams, made up of industry representatives, recommend measures to address the specific needs in their respective management areas. Federal waters contain portions of six of the seven management areas. Only Area 6 is totally within state waters (Long Island Sound, which consists of New York and Connecticut state waters).Managed in state waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) under the <a href=\"http://www.asmfc.org/species/american-lobster\">Interstate Fishery Management Plan for American Lobster</a>. Each management area has unique regulations that include:Limits on the minimum and maximum size of lobster than can be harvested.Trap limits control fishing effort. Each lobster vessel is limited to either a vessel-based trap allocation based on its historical fishing practices, or an area-wide trap cap (the maximum number of traps a vessel may fish in a specific area). Measures to protect egg-bearing females—fishermen may not harvest them and, in most areas, if one is caught in their trap, they must notch its tail fin in a “v” shape before returning it to the water.Prohibition on possession of lobster meat and lobster parts (lobsters must be landed live and whole to ensure they are of legal size).Gear restrictions, trap configuration requirements, and prohibition on using spears to fish for lobsters.Restrictions on the amount of lobster that can be harvested with non-trap gear.Monitoring and reporting requirements.A <a href=\"https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/nr/2017/July/17lobttpgphl.pdf\">trap transfer program</a> was initiated in 2015 in a subset of the management areas that allows Federal permit holders to purchase partial trap allocation from other authorized permit holders. Others may sell allocation to other Federal lobster permit holders to downsize their own fishing operations and allow other permit holders to gain access to the trap fishery in certain management areas.Managed in federal waters (3 to 200 nautical miles offshore) under regulations implemented through the <a href=\"http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/ACFCMA.pdf\">Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act</a>, including:Fishermen must have a permit to harvest lobster. A temporary moratorium on the issuance of federal lobster permits, which limits the amount of available permits to control the number of fishermen harvesting lobster, was extended indefinitely in 1999.Limits on the minimum and maximum size of lobsters that can be harvested, which varies by management area.Prohibition on possession of lobster meat and lobster parts (lobsters must be landed live and whole to ensure they are of legal size).Measures to protect egg-bearing females—fishermen may not harvest them and, in most areas, if one is caught in their trap, they must notch its tail fin in a “v” shape before returning it to the water.Gear restrictions (trap size, gear marking requirements, escape vents, and ghost panels).Trap limits, which vary among management areas.To improve data collection in the fishery, all federal lobster dealers must submit weekly electronic reports for all lobsters they purchase from fishermen with federal permits. Federal lobster permit holders are not required to report landings unless they have another Federal fishery permit, in addition to their Federal lobster permit, that  requires landings reports (e.g., Northeast multispecies permit).Area-specific measures have been approved to reduce fishing exploitation on the Southern New England stock, including biological and effort control management measures.Regulations require biodegradable escape panels or hinges on traps to prevent ghost fishing (when lost gear continues to capture lobster and other species). Escape panels must be large enough to reduce bycatch of undersized lobsters.​<a href=\"http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/sustainable-durable/fisheries-peches/lobster-homard-eng.htm\">Fisheries and Oceans Canada</a> manages the American lobster resource in Canadian territorial waters of the northwest Atlantic Ocean.",
        "Fishing Rate": "Not subject to overfishing.",

        "Habitat": "American lobsters live on the ocean floor.They live alone and are very territorial.They can live in a variety of habitats as long as there is a burrow or crevice for cover.Coastal lobsters like rocky areas where they can readily find shelter, although they’re sometimes found in mud bottoms where they can burrow.Offshore populations are most abundant along the edge of the continental shelf near underwater canyons.Near the coast, small lobsters do not travel much, but larger ones may travel extensively. Offshore lobsters migrate during the spring anywhere from 50 to 190 miles.Scientists, managers, and fishermen are concerned about the habitat conditions for American lobster in inshore Southern New England waters, particularly in Long Island Sound. Scientists believe that a combination of warmer water temperatures, hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen levels), and other stress factors resulted in lobster die-offs in western Long Island Sound in late 1999 and in 2002. If these conditions continue, future die-offs are possible. Researchers also believe that increased water temperatures in Southern New England may be driving lobsters to cooler offshore waters and disrupting the settlement of larvae in traditional coastal areas.",
        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "Commercial fishery:In 2021, commercial landings of American lobster totaled 134.7 million pounds and were valued at $925 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:29869960868046::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>.The two stocks of American lobster—Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank, and Southern New England—support both inshore and offshore fisheries. The Gulf of Maine and Southern New England areas are predominantly inshore fisheries, while the Georges Bank area is predominantly an offshore fishery. Most U.S. harvest is caught in inshore waters.There’s a reason we associate Maine with lobsters—the state has led American lobster landings for over 3 decades. Massachusetts is the second leading producer. Together, these two states produce 93 percent of the total U.S. American lobster harvest, and 93 percent of the coast-wide landings come from the Gulf of Maine lobster stock.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Most fishermen use traps to harvest lobster. They bait rectangular, wire-mesh traps then lower them to the ocean floor in water 15 to 1,000 feet deep. A buoy that marks the trap’s location is attached to the trap line. Fishermen haul the traps back to the surface every few days to check their catch, although the frequency varies depending on the season and the location.The Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot fishery can incidentally entangle large whales. To reduce injuries and deaths of large whales due to fisheries interactions, the <a href=\"https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/\">Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan</a> was implemented in 1997. The plan continues to evolve as we learn more about why whales become entangled and how fishing practices might be modified to reduce the risk of entanglement. Lobstermen must follow a number of regulations to protect large whales from fishing gear. For example, lobstermen must use sinking groundlines between traps to reduce the amount of line in the water column, which reduces the potential for whales and other protected species to become entangled. In addition, lobster permit holders are required to haul their active traps at least once every 30 days. Learn more about these and other actions in the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/north-atlantic-right-whale#road-recovery\">North Atlantic Right Whale Road to Recovery</a>, NOAA Fisheries' multi-pronged approach to address threats and monitor progress.Traps can incidentally catch finfish and invertebrates (such as crabs and conch). Regulations require traps to be configured with biodegradable escape panels or hinges on traps to prevent ghost fishing (lost gear that continues to capture lobster and other species and may pose a hazard to other marine species). Escape panels must be large enough to reduce bycatch of undersized lobsters.Recreational fishery:Recreational fishermen catch lobsters in coastal waters with pots and by hand while scuba diving. Recreational fishermen with a federal lobster permit may harvest lobster in federal waters, but the lobster cannot be sold.",

By removing escape vents from the lobster traps and randomly placing those traps within certain depth categories and geographic areas, researchers can assess the abundance of juvenile lobsters and the potential for young lobsters to reach a size or life stage that can be caught by the fishing gear (recruitment) in the future. These surveys complement longstanding fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys conducted by NOAA Fisheries and the states. Because trawl gear cannot effectively sample rocky or shallow coastal bottom types, the ventless trap surveys attempt to fill this data gap by using fixed lobster gear without escape vents.",

The instrument will allow high-volume screening of individual kelp plants for desired traits such as high-temperature tolerance. This method may be used in the future for improving sugar kelp strains.Human health:Milford Lab scientists, through a grant from the NOAA Aquaculture Program, are also studying different kinds of organisms like bacteria, micro-and macro-algae that may be growing on the surface of sugar kelp at different stages of the kelp’s growth. They isolated Vibrio bacteria from the plant to see how abundance changes throughout the growing season. They have found that Vibrio is absent during most of the growing season since this bacteria prefers warmer waters. This information can help growers harvest in the best possible conditions.Energy:One of the Milford Lab’s sugar kelp collaborators also received $5.7 million in 2017 from the Department of Energy through the agency’s program focused on advancing seaweed energy production, Macroalgae Research Inspiring Novel Energy Resources (MARINER).

The <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr2706/text\" rel=\"external\">Billfish Conservation Act</a>, along with existing billfish regulations, prohibits the sale and commercial possession of billfish and billfish products. However, those that are caught in Hawaii and the Pacific Insular Areas (which includes American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands) are exempt and can be sold.Prohibitions on the sale of striped marlin on the U.S. West Coast provide a strong disincentive for commercial fishermen to catch striped marlin.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Marlin are primarily caught incidentally in pelagic longline commercial fisheries for tuna and swordfish.U.S. pelagic longline fishermen, who target tuna and swordfish and may incidentally catch striped marlin, are required to use specific tools and handling techniques to mitigate bycatch of sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals. The Hawaii longline regulation summary can be found <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/hawaii-pelagic-longline-regulation-summary\">here</a>.If too many interactions with sea turtles occur, NOAA Fisheries closes the fishery for the remainder of the year.To prevent seabird interactions, deep and shallow-set longline vessels must either deploy longline gear from the side of the vessel (as opposed to the back of the vessel) or use blue-dyed bait (which is less visible to seabirds).In the deep-set longline sector, vessels must use circle hooks and certain gear setups to allow whales to bend the hooks and escape an incidental hooking.Time-area closures also limit and prevent interactions between pelagic longline gear and non-target species.Recreational fishery:Striped marlin are a favorite target for recreational fishermen and one of the most sought-after billfish in the region because the fish are acrobatic and tend to put up an incredible fight when hooked.Hawaii hosts one of the largest billfish tournaments in the United States. Most fish caught in recreational tournaments are tagged and released.

They return to rest on the ocean floor during the day, preferring sandy, muddy, or pebbly ocean bottoms.Red hake migrate in response to seasonal changes in water temperatures, moving toward shallow, warmer waters in the spring.They spawn in these shallow waters during late spring and early summer and then return to deeper waters in the autumn.Juveniles seek shelter from predators in scallop beds and commonly hide underneath <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-sea-scallop\">sea scallops</a>.Older, larger red hake prefer deeper waters.During the summer, portions of both stocks can be found on Georges Bank.During the winter, fish in the northern stock move to deep basins in the Gulf of Maine, while fish in the southern stock move to outer continental shelf and slope waters.Red hake are widely distributed, and have been observed at temperature ranges of 2 to 17° C (36 to 63° F) and depth ranges of 11 to 500 meters (36 to 1,640 feet).

Some are also sold as fillets.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Fishermen using small-mesh trawl gear to catch red hake must comply with a number of specific requirements to reduce bycatch of larger groundfish species.In designated areas, fishermen are required to use raised-footrope trawls, which are designed to keep the net off the bottom to reduce the bycatch of flatfish and other species.Recreational fishery:Recreational fishermen do not target red hake but sometimes catch them incidentally while fishing for other groundfish.There are currently no restrictions on possession, size, or gear-type for red hake caught recreationally in federal waters.There are no specific areas for the recreational fishery.",

More information regarding limited access permits can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-fishery-compliance-guides\">Atlantic HMS commercial compliance guide</a>.Atlantic sharpnose shark belong to the small coastal shark (SCS) complex. For SCS sharks, there is no retention limit per vessel per trip for commercial fishermen with a directed permit.They are harvested primarily off the east coast of Florida and North Carolina.Their meat is sold as seafood and also used by fishermen as bait for other larger species of shark.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Commercial fishermen primarily use gillnet and bottom longline gear, which have minimal impacts on habitat due to how and where they are deployed.These gear types sometimes interact with sea turtles, marine mammals, and the endangered smalltooth sawfish.Several measures are in place to protect species that may be caught unintentionally in Atlantic sharpnose shark fisheries.Fishermen using bottom longline or gillnet gear must complete a protected species safe handling, release, and identification <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-protected-species-safe-handling-release-and\">workshop</a>, and all bottom longline vessels must carry <a href=\"http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/gulf_sa/turtle_sawfish_release/index.html\">sea turtle handling and release gear</a> on board.To reduce bycatch of finfish, including Atlantic sharpnose shark, shrimp trawlers are required to use <a href=\"https://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/labs/mississippi/brd/\">bycatch reduction devices</a>, which are designed to retain shrimp but allow fish to exit the net.Recreational fishery:In 2021, approximately 464,000 pounds of Atlantic sharpnose shark were caught recreationally in the United States, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200:21826065749539::NO:::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>.Recreational fishermen primarily use rod and reel gear, which have minimal impacts on habitat and bycatch.Recreational fishermen must have an Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-permits\">HMS permit</a> to harvest Atlantic sharpnose sharks in federal waters. As of January 1, 2018, all HMS recreational permit holders will need a “shark endorsement” to fish for, retain, possess, or land sharks.Fishermen fishing recreationally for sharks will be required to use circle hook in most places.

        "Environmental Effects": "Federal and state regulations and monitoring requirements ensure that salmon farming (as practiced in the United States) has minimal impact on the environment.",
        "Farming Methods": "Atlantic salmon are spawned and raised in on-land hatcheries until large enough for transfer to net-pens in coastal waters.",
        "Farming Methods_": "Hatchery Production:Salmon hatcheries supply juvenile fish for both stock enhancement and commercial farms.Hatcheries can use captive or wild broodstock.Male and female salmon are spawned, and fertilized eggs are transferred to environmentally controlled tanks.After hatching into fry, juvenile salmon are raised to 40-120 grams and transferred to a grow-out facility or released for stock enhancement.Grow-out Facilities:Farmed salmon grow-out facilities are typically coastal net pens, which are enclosed cages submerged in aquatic environments.Grow-out can also be in full or partial recirculating systems on land.",

        "Feeds": "Resource Efficiency:Salmon farming is one of the most resource-efficient methods to produce protein compared to other animal food production.The feed conversion ratio (FCR) is the amount of feed eaten by a fish relative to the amount of food it provides for human consumption.Farmed salmon have a more efficient FCR than wild fish and many terrestrial livestock including cows, pigs and chickens.Fishmeal &amp; Fish Oil:Fishmeal and fish oil contain the balance of nutrients that most closely resemble the requirements of fish.About 70% of global fishmeal and oil production comes from fisheries targeted at small, pelagic fish, such as sardine, anchovy and menhaden.The remainder comes from processing fish wastes.The world supply of fishmeal and oil coming from fisheries has remained constant over several decades.Fishmeal and oil prices have increased dramatically over the last decade due to increased use of these fisheries for direct human consumption, and increased demand for fish oil for human nutraceuticals.The aquaculture industry has developed feeds that use less or no fishmeal or fish oil, and has increased the use of fish processing waste.The amount of fishmeal and oil in aquaculture is decreasing and projected to continue to decrease.Alternative Feeds:Feeds eliminating fishmeal and oil have been successfully used to grow Atlantic Salmon.NOAA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/noaa-usda-alternative-feeds-initiative\">Alternative Feeds Initiative</a> in 2007 to collaborate on research for alternative fish feeds.The 2012 report, <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/webdam/download/65606475\">The Future of Aquafeeds</a>, can be accessed here.The FDA approved an ingredient called taurine for use as a supplement in fish feed in 2017, which reduces reliance on fish meal and oil.",

Juvenile winter skates are difficult to differentiate from little skates because they look nearly identical.The wing fishery is labor-intensive because the wings need to be cut into fillets, but participation has grown recently due to increasing restrictions on other, more profitable groundfish species.In the wing fishery, mainly trawlers and gillnetters harvest winter skates when targeting other species such as groundfish, monkfish, and scallops. Fishermen keep the skates if the price is profitable.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Most skates are caught incidentally in otter trawl fisheries targeting other more valuable species, such as groundfish, monkfish, and scallops. Otter trawls can impact habitat depending on where they are used. They can also interact with marine mammals (e.g., whales, harbor porpoises, and seals) and sea turtles. Management measures including closed areas, restrictions on gear and fishing effort, and modifying fishing gear to reduce contact with habitat help reduce these impacts and interactions.Skates are also caught in bottom gillnet fisheries, which have less of an impact on habitat.Skates are caught and discarded as bycatch in numerous fisheries, but the rate of discards has decreased in recent years as the value of skate products has increased.",

In fact, they’re among the fastest growing of the Pacific salmon species.After about 1½ years of feeding and growing in the ocean, maturing pink salmon return to fresh water to spawn, usually from August to October.Females construct nests (redds) in the riverbed by turning on their sides and vigorously flexing their bodies and tails, digging a shallow hole.Females deposit between 1,200 and 1,900 eggs in the redds, which the males then fertilize.The female stays and defends her redd from other females until she dies, usually within two weeks.All pink salmon die after they spawn.They typically spawn at the age of 2.Because the pink salmon life cycle is so regular, independent populations spawn in even and odd years. For example, in the southern part of their range, they usually spawn in odd years in most river systems. However, pink salmon do spawn in even years in some Puget Sound rivers.Throughout most of Alaska, there is no dominant year, except in the northwestern part of Alaska where even-year runs predominate.Pink salmon feed on small crustaceans, zooplankton (tiny floating animals), squid, and small fish.In fresh water, aquatic invertebrates, other fishes, birds, and small mammals prey on pink salmon eggs, alevins, and fry.In the ocean, other fishes (including other Pacific salmon) and coastal seabirds prey on pink salmon fry and juveniles.Marine mammals, sharks, other fishes (such as <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/pacific-halibut\">Pacific halibut</a>), and humpback whales feed on adult pink salmon.In freshwater spawning habitats, bears are predators of adult pink salmon. Wolves, river otters, and bald eagles will also occasionally eat pre-spawning adult pinks.After salmon spawn and die, <a href=\"http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=97&amp;issue_id=21\" rel=\"external\">salmon carcasses</a> are a valuable source of energy and nutrients to the river ecosystem.

Using this information, they make recommendations for management of the upcoming fishing season.Their general goal is to allow fishermen to harvest the maximum amount of salmon that will support the fishery while preventing overharvest of the resource and ensuring that salmon populations with low abundance can rebuild.Specific management measures vary year to year depending on current salmon abundance, and include size limits, season length, quotas, and gear restrictions.The council usually increases harvest limits for pink salmon in odd years when more adults are returning to spawn.Management of pink salmon must also comply with laws such as the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/laws-policies#endangered-species-act\">Endangered Species Act</a>.Final recommendations are implemented by NOAA Fisheries. <a href=\"https://www.pcouncil.org/salmon/current-season-management/\">Check here</a> for the current season’s management.

They want enough salmon to be able to escape the fishery and return to fresh water to spawn and replenish the population.Salmon fishery management largely relies on in-season assessment of how many salmon return to fresh water to spawn.Managers set harvest levels based on these returns. When abundance is high and the number of fish returning is much higher than that needed to meet escapement goals, harvest levels are set higher.In years of low abundance, harvest levels are lowered.During the fishing season, scientists monitor catch and escapement, comparing current returns with those from previous years, to keep an eye on abundance and actively manage the fishery.Off the West Coast and in Alaska, the <a href=\"https://www.psc.org/about_treaty.htm\" rel=\"external\">Pacific Salmon Treaty</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.psc.org/index.htm\" rel=\"external\">Pacific Salmon Commission</a> help coordinate management, research, and enhancement of shared U.S. and international salmon stocks, including pink salmon.",

Since there has been a fishing moratorium in place since 2014, there is no directed fishing, and the stock is not subject to overfishing.Abundance of northern shrimp is primarily monitored by the joint State-Federal summer <a href=\"http://www.asmfc.org/fisheries-science/surveys\">shrimp survey</a>. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s Northern Shrimp Technical Committee provides annual stock assessments and related information to fishery managers.Recruitment of northern shrimp is dependent on several factors including ocean temperatures and spawning biomass. Ocean temperatures in the western Gulf of Maine have increased in recent years and are predicted to continue rising. This suggests an increasingly inhospitable environment for northern shrimp and the need for strong conservation efforts to help sustain the stock.An increase in northern shrimp predators (<a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-spiny-dogfish\">spiny dogfish</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/acadian-redfish\">redfish</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/silver-hake\">silver hake</a>) may also be contributing to a decline in the stock.",

Swordfish live for about 9 years.Swordfish feed on a variety of fish and invertebrates such as squid.They capture their prey by slashing their bills back and forth, stunning or injuring the prey in the process.They have developed unique characteristics, such as special eye muscles and a heat exchange system that allow them to swim in deep cold water in search of prey.Swordfish feed at the top of the food chain and are rarely preyed upon by other animals, but juvenile swordfish are sometimes eaten by sharks and larger predatory fish.",

Foreign purse seiners and baitboats have used FADs extensively in the Atlantic since the early 1990s to catch skipjack, primarily off the coast of West Africa. Researchers have found that the increasing use of FADs has changed the species composition of tuna catches, resulting in a higher capture rate of juvenile <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-yellowfin-tuna\">yellowfin</a> and bigeye tuna for vessels targeting <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-skipjack-tuna\">skipjack</a>. The higher capture rate of juvenile bigeye tuna in purse seine fisheries associated with FADs has been demonstrated by ICCAT to reduce the overall maximum sustainable yield of the stock. The increased presence of FADs may also have an impact on the biology and ecology of skipjack, bigeye, and yellowfin tuna. Also, sea turtles and marine mammals can become entangled in nets, ropes, and lines that are used in the FADs. This research influenced ICAAT’s requirements related to the use of FADs in the bigeye tuna fishery (see management section).",

Females release their hatched larvae from late spring through July and August.Females generally produce between 15,000 and 20,000 larvae per spawning cycle.Newly hatched redfish can swim well at birth and are soon able to forage for plankton (tiny floating plants and animals).Their survival rate is relatively high compared with that of egg-laying fish.Young redfish stay in the upper waters feeding on small crustaceans until they are about 2 inches long.In the fall, the young settle to the ocean bottom.Older redfish feed on larger invertebrates and small fish.",

NOAA Fisheries periodically reviews these states’ regulations to make sure they’re consistent with federal regulations.Highly migratory species, such as skipjack tuna have complicated management that requires international cooperation.The United States participates in regional fisheries management organizations, such as the <a href=\"http://www.iccat.int/en/\" rel=\"external\">International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas</a> (ICCAT), to enhance tuna management worldwide. NOAA Fisheries sets regulations for the U.S. western Atlantic skipjack tuna fishery based on our science as well as conservation and management measures adopted by ICCAT.No specific ICCAT management measures currently apply to skipjack tuna.In 2013, ICCAT adopted a measure to expand reporting requirements for tropical tuna fisheries using <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/bycatch/fishing-gear-fish-aggregating-devices\">fish aggregating devices</a> (FADs). The measure will improve data collection and allow ICCAT scientists to better characterize the fishing effort associated with FAD fishing.In 2000, the United States established the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/dolphin-safe\">Dolphin-Safe Tuna Tracking and Verification Program</a> to monitor the domestic production and importation of all frozen and processed tuna products nationwide and to authenticate any associated dolphin-safe claim.",

They grow quickly for the first few years of their life.The largest scallop ever reported was about 9 inches in shell height, but they typically don’t grow larger than 6 inches.Sea scallops can reproduce by age 2, but don’t produce many eggs or sperm until they are about 4 years old.They are very fertile—a female sea scallop can produce hundreds of millions of eggs per year. For this reason, scallops may respond more rapidly to management actions than species that reproduce slowly and in small numbers.Sea scallops usually spawn in late summer or early fall. They also may spawn in the spring, especially in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.After hatching, scallop larvae remain in the water column for 4 to 6 weeks before settling on the ocean floor.Sea scallops feed by filtering phytoplankton or other small organisms out of the water column, which can actually help to improve water quality by removing suspended materials.Many kinds of pelagic fish and invertebrates eat scallop larvae.Cod, wolffish, eel pout, flounder, crabs, lobster, sea turtles, and sea stars feed on juvenile and adult scallops.Using its adductor muscle to snap its top and bottom shells open and shut, a sea scallop can propel itself through the water. This helps them escape predators, such as sea stars, that other bivalves like mussels, clams, and oysters can’t avoid.",

They allocate this catch amount to different groups of the fishery, depending on their permit type and historical catch, through days-at-sea and number of trips to special access areas.Other management measures include:Limits on crew size.Areas closed to scallop dredging to allow young scallops to grow large and reproduce, and to reduce bycatch of non-targeted species.Vessels harvesting scallops must use <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/enforcement/vessel-monitoring\">vessel monitoring systems</a> (a satellite communications system used to monitor fishing activities).Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQs), a type of <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/laws-and-policies/catch-shares\">catch share</a> program, for Limited Access General Category permit holders.There is a sea scallop fishery in the Gulf of Maine that operates in both federal and state waters.

        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "Commercial fishery:In 2021, commercial landings of Atlantic sea scallop totaled 43 million pounds of sea scallop meats and were valued at $670 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200::::::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>.Scallop vessels from Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Jersey are responsible for the majority of the U.S. harvest.The principal U.S. commercial fisheries for sea scallop are in the Mid-Atlantic (from Virginia to Long Island, New York) and on Georges Bank and neighboring areas, such as the Great South Channel and Nantucket Shoals. There is also a small, primarily inshore fishery for sea scallops in the Gulf of Maine.The U.S. sea scallop fishery is extremely important to the U.S. economy and is the largest wild scallop fishery in the world.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:U.S. commercial fishermen harvest sea scallops year-round, primarily using turtle deflector–style scallop dredges that catch scallops much like rakes collect leaves.A small number of fishermen use otter trawls, mostly in the Mid-Atlantic.Divers and Digby dredges are sometimes used in near-shore areas in the Gulf of Maine.The bottom fishing gears used to harvest scallops, such as dredges and trawls, can remove some bottom habitat–forming organisms, including tubeworms and sponges.Managers have implemented a variety of measures to protect habitat from potential impacts of <a href=\"https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/species/scallop/\">fishing gear</a>:Several areas are closed year-round to harvesting scallops to protect sensitive habitat.Managers have implemented a rotational access area program, which restricts where and when scallop vessels can fish, benefitting both habitat and scallop populations.Fishermen use 4-inch rings in their scallop dredges that increase the dredges’ efficiency, catching larger scallops and allowing smaller scallops and other small marine life to return to the sea floor by passing through the dredge rings. The 4-inch rings reduce the amount of time dredges contact the bottom.Sea turtles, finfish (such as yellowtail flounder, skates, and monkfish), and undersized scallops can be incidentally caught in the scallop fishery.Managers seasonally prohibit fishing in areas where finfish species congregate, reducing catch of these untargeted species.Scallop fishermen receive annual allocations of windowpane and yellowtail flounder that they can catch. If the catches are exceeded, managers will implement measures to minimize catch of these species in a future fishing year (e.g., gear restrictions and seasonal closures).Scallop vessels in the Mid-Atlantic must use a <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/atlantic-sea-scallop-turtle-deflector-dredge-and-chain-mat-regulated-areas\">turtle deflector dredge and chain mat</a> when and where sea turtles occur on scallop grounds. The turtle deflector dredge excludes sea turtles from being caught in the dredge and prevents serious injuries to the turtles.Scallop dredges using “twine-tops” must adhere to gear modifications designed to allow fish to escape.Research and experimentation with different techniques and gears, as well as education efforts, have helped reduce bycatch.Managers and the fishing industry continue to collaborate to redesign scallop dredges to reduce flounder bycatch and to minimize injuries to and capture of sea turtles.",

They divide the survey area into zones of various depths and habitat, then tow a dredge and camera to randomly sample and document the marine life and other conditions in these zones. After each tow, they sort, count, and measure their catch. Dredge catches provide relative indices of the average density of animals, along with some information about bottom type and habitat.Scientists have recently started using a new undersea camera called the “<a href=\"http://habcam.whoi.edu/\" rel=\"external\">HabCam</a>” in scallop surveys to supplement the dredge data. The HabCam (short for Habitat Mapping Camera System) was developed by scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution working with Cape Cod scallop fishermen. Images from the HabCam supply absolute densities of scallops and other species, are less labor intensive in terms of crew, and provide much more information about the bottom habitat, all in near-real time. Using both the annual dredge surveys and the HabCam provides a more complete picture of the scallop population and its habitat.Scientists use information from these surveys along with data from other surveys and the commercial fishery to estimate abundance (biomass) and assess the health of the population and the sustainability of the fishery.Under the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/funding-and-financial-services/research-set-aside-programs\">Scallop Research Set-Aside Program</a>, 1.25 million pounds (567 metric tons) of the allowed scallop harvest is set aside each year to fund scallop and habitat research and surveys to provide better information for future management decisions. This is not a federally-funded program. Participating scallop vessels fund research through the sale of the scallops they harvest. Past projects have focused on gear research to minimize bycatch of finfish, sea turtles, and small scallops; surveys of rotational access areas and other areas; studies of scallop biology; and development of survey technologies.",

        "Biology": "Atlantic salmon are anadromous – they leave the ocean to return to freshwater streams and rivers to breed.Females lay an average of 7,500 eggs in gravel nests, called redds.Eggs incubate slowly due to cold winter water temperatures. About 9 to 20 percent of the eggs survive to the fry stage.Fry remain buried in the gravel for about 6 weeks and emerge in mid-May.They quickly disperse from the redds and develop camouflaging stripes along their sides, entering the parr stage.Parr eventually undergo a physiological transformation called smoltification that prepares them for life in a marine habitat. During smoltification, fish imprint on the chemical nature of the stream or river to enable them to find their way back to where they were born. After smoltfication is complete in the spring, smolts migrate to the ocean to grow, feed, and mature.Atlantic salmon growth rates are variable and depend on several factors including season, habitat quality, age, sex, and population density.They grow much faster in saltwater than in freshwater. After 2 years at sea, adult salmon can grow to an average length of 28 to 30 inches and weight of 8 to 12 pounds.Unlike the Pacific salmon species, Atlantic salmon do not die after spawning, and adults can repeat the breeding cycle. They live for 4 to 6 years.Juvenile Atlantic salmon mostly prey on invertebrates and terrestrial insects while in freshwater and on amphipods (small, shrimp-like crustaceans), krill, and fishes while at sea.Larger adult Atlantic salmon mainly prey on fish such as Atlantic herring, alewife, rainbow smelt, capelin, mummichogs, sand lances, flatfish, and small Atlantic mackerel.Birds, marine mammals, and fish prey on Atlantic salmon.",

This protects Atlantic salmon in U.S. marine waters and complements management in state-managed riverine and coastal waters.In 2000, NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Gulf of Maine distinct population segment of Atlantic salmon as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The two agencies are jointly responsible for the recovery of this endangered population of Atlantic salmon.In December 2005, the agencies, in coordination with the State of Maine, finalized the Recovery Plan for the Gulf of Maine distinct population segment. This plan identifies recovery actions needed to halt the decline of the species and lays out a process to minimize threats.In June 2009, they extended Endangered Species Act protection to more Atlantic salmon, adding fish in the Penobscot, Kennebec, and Androscoggin rivers and their tributaries to the endangered Gulf of Maine distinct population segment. Protection also applies wherever these fish are found, including these rivers’ estuaries and marine environment.A new recovery plan is being developed to reflect the expanded range of endangered salmon and the designation of their critical habitat (the area needed to support the fish population’s survival and recovery).In 2015, NOAA Fisheries announced a new program to focus and redouble our efforts to protect eight species that are currently among the most at risk of extinction in the near future. This 5-year action plan focuses on priority actions for Atlantic salmon. <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/atlantic-salmon-protected/spotlight\">Species in the Spotlight</a>International management:Because Atlantic salmon migrate all along the North American coast, the United States joined with other North Atlantic nations in 1984 to form the <a href=\"http://www.nasco.int/\" rel=\"external\">North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization</a> (NASCO) to cooperatively manage Atlantic salmon stocks through conservation, restoration, and enhancement programs.The United States’ participation in NASCO supports the long-term commitment by the states and federal government to rehabilitate and restore U.S. Atlantic salmon stocks.The <a href=\"http://www.ices.dk/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"external\">International Council for the Exploration of the Sea</a> (ICES) is the official research arm of NASCO. ICES provides scientific advice to NASCO members to inform science-based management recommendations for the conservation of North Atlantic salmon stocks.Substantial efforts are ongoing to restore wild Atlantic salmon and their habitat. These include improving fish passage by removing or modifying dams so salmon can reach freshwater spawning and rearing areas critical to their survival, understanding and improving historically low salmon survival in the ocean, and supplementing wild populations with hatchery-raised Atlantic salmon.Atlantic salmon have been raised in hatcheries since 1864 to enhance wild populations. Today, these hatcheries help to prevent further decline of Atlantic salmon and subsequently prevent their extinction.In the late 1970s, commercial aquaculture ventures started rearing Atlantic salmon in Maine.

NOAA Fisheries periodically reviews these states’ regulations to make sure they’re consistent with federal regulations.Highly migratory species, such as yellowfin tuna, have complicated management that requires international cooperation.The United States participates in regional fisheries management organizations, such as the <a href=\"http://www.iccat.int/en/\" rel=\"external\">International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas</a> (ICCAT), to enhance tuna management worldwide. NOAA Fisheries sets regulations for the U.S. western Atlantic yellowfin tuna fishery based on our science as well as conservation and management measures adopted by ICCAT.In 2011, ICCAT adopted new yellowfin tuna management standards that reduced the catch of small yellowfin off West Africa and brought other fishing nations closer to U.S. standards.In 2013, ICCAT adopted a measure to expand reporting requirements for tropical tuna fisheries using <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/bycatch/fishing-gear-fish-aggregating-devices\">fish aggregating devices</a> (FADs). The measure will improve data collection and allow ICCAT scientists to better characterize the fishing effort associated with FAD fishing.In 2000, the United States established the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/dolphin-safe\">Dolphin-Safe Tuna Tracking and Verification Program</a> to monitor the domestic production and importation of all frozen and processed tuna products nationwide and to authenticate any associated dolphin-safe claim.",

",
        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "Commercial fishery:U.S. landings of Atlantic yellowfin tuna generally represent a small percentage of the total international landings of Atlantic yellowfin tuna.In 2021, commercial landings of Atlantic yellowfin tuna totaled 1.4 million pounds and were valued at $5.4 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:28806357993474::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>.Yellowfin tuna is the principal species of tropical tuna landed by U.S. fisheries in the western North Atlantic.The majority of U.S. commercial landings come from the longline fleet operating in the northwest Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:U.S. commercial fishermen primarily use longline, rod-and-reel, and handline gear to harvest Atlantic yellowfin tuna.Pelagic longline gear and handgear (handline and rod-and-reel) used to catch yellowfin tuna have no impact on habitat because they’re used in the water column and don’t come into contact with the ocean floor.Handgear is very selective so bycatch is minimal, but pelagic longlines can incidentally catch other fish and protected species such as marine mammals and sea turtles.NOAA Fisheries has taken the following additional measures to prevent bycatch and sustainably manage this fishery. Fishermen are:Required to use large circle hooks and certain types of bait that limit gear interactions with sea turtles. Circle hooks are specifically designed to minimize the damage caused by hooking, giving animals that are captured and released a better chance at survival.Trained to use special techniques to safely dehook and release any incidentally caught turtles.Required to stop fishing and move 1 nautical mile if they encounter a protected species.Required to protect pilot whales and Risso's dolphins when fishing in the Mid-Atlantic Bight by limiting the length of their lines to 20 nautical miles and posting <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/safe-handling-release-and-identification-workshops?_ga=2.56502568.2022413580.1600088945-1749182424.1566822859\">marine mammal handling/release guidelines</a> on their vessels. In addition, if fishing in the Cape Hatteras Special Research Area, pelagic longliners must contact NOAA Fisheries at least 48 hours prior to a trip and carry observers if requested.Required to use <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/pelagic-longline-bluefin-tuna-area-based-and-weak-hook-management-measures?_ga=2.99541149.2022413580.1600088945-1749182424.1566822859\">weak hooks</a> in the Gulf of Mexico to reduce incidental catch of bluefin tuna and prohibited from using live bait to reduce bycatch of billfish.Restricted from areas of the Gulf of Mexico to reduce bycatch of all species.Required to carry <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/enforcement/vessel-monitoring\">vessel monitoring systems</a> onboard their boats to ensure compliance with these closures.Required to carry at-sea fisheries observers upon request. NOAA Fisheries reviews observer data to monitor protected species interactions and takes appropriate action as necessary.Recreational fishery:A high proportion of landings are rod-and-reel catches by recreational anglers.In 2021, recreational fishermen landed 12 million pounds of Atlantic yellowfin tuna, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200:15392611375578::NO:RP::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>.Recreational fishermen enjoy catching yellowfin tuna because they’re large (up to 400 pounds) and they fight hard.Recreational fishermen must have a permit to catch yellowfin tuna.They have daily bag limits. However, catch, tag, and release is allowed.Recreational fishing for highly migratory species such as yellowfin tuna provides significant economic benefits to coastal communities through individual angler expenditures, recreational charters, tournaments, and the shoreside businesses that support those activities.",

Squid hatched in the summer grow faster than those hatched in the winter. They spawn year-round, with peak production in winter and summer. The male cements bundles of spermatophores into the mantle cavity of the female and/or deposits them in a pouch located near her mouth. The spermatophores penetrate the ova, or sperm is stored for later use. The female lays fertilized egg capsules that contain about 150 to 200 eggs each in clusters attached to the ocean bottom, with a typical female laying a total of 3,000 to 6,000 eggs. Eggs hatch between 11 and 26 days later, depending on water temperature.Small immature longfin squid feed on plankton, and larger squid feed on crustaceans and small fish.They are aggressive hunters, can consume fish larger than themselves, and do eat their own species.They are a key prey species for a variety of marine mammals, diving birds, and finfish species.

All other fishermen must obtain an incidental catch permit, and have possession limits.An annual coastwide catch quota is divided into trimester allocations. Managers monitor annual quotas closely, as there can be large fluctuations in abundance from year to year.Managers set a cap on the amount of <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/butterfish\">butterfish</a> that can be incidentally caught in the longfin squid fishery to help prevent overfishing on the butterfish stock.",

North of Cape Hatteras, squid migrate seasonally—offshore during late autumn to spend the winter in warmer waters along the shelf edge and slope, and back inshore during the spring where they remain until late autumn.Squid egg masses are attached to rocks and small boulders or aquatic vegetation and on sandy bottoms.Paralarvae are found in surface waters.

Fisheries for longfin squid reflect the species’ seasonal migrations.The majority of landings come from Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.Harvested for bait since the late 1800s, longfin squid have been harvested since the mid-1960’s for their mild, sweet meat.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:The majority of longfin squid is harvested year-round using small-mesh bottom trawls. There are now only a few fishermen that use pound nets and fish traps during the spring and early summer when squid migrate inshore.Sandy or muddy habitat, where squid are fished, is less sensitive to the impacts of trawling.Small-mesh bottom trawls can incidentally catch marine mammals and large pelagic species, including pilot whales, common dolphin, swordfish, and a variety of shark, ray, and tuna species. Finfish such as butterfish, hakes, Illex squid, fluke, herring, spiny dogfish, and Atlantic mackerel are also incidentally caught in this fishery.Measures to prevent or minimize bycatch include:Bycatch cap for <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/butterfish\">butterfish</a> caught in the longfin fishery.Minimum mesh size requirements for bottom trawl nets, but bycatch escapement is very limited because the codend mesh sizes are very small (1 7/8 in. during Trimester 2 and 2 1/8 in. during Trimesters 1 and 3) and are covered by an additional layer of mesh called a strengthener.Outreach to fishermen to educate them on actions to take in the event of a marine mammal interaction.Real-time communication to vessels regarding hotspots of marine mammal interactions.",

Females release about 500,000 to 1 million eggs near the ocean floor, and the eggs are fertilized as they are released.Newly hatched shrimp travel to their estuarine nursery habitats in April and early May.Shrimp that survive the winter grow rapidly in late winter and early spring before returning to the ocean.White shrimp larvae feed on plankton (tiny floating plants and animals).Juvenile and adult shrimp are omnivorous and feed on the bottom on detritus, plants, microorganisms, macroinvertebrates, and small fish. Cannibalism is also common among adult white shrimp.Sheepshead minnows, water boatmen, and insect larvae eat postlarval shrimp, and grass shrimp, killifishes, and blue crabs prey on young shrimp.A wide variety of finfish feed heavily on juvenile and adult shrimp.",

Working with the U.S. Department of State, NOAA Fisheries domestically implements the IATTC and WCPFC conservation and management measures.The United States has implemented conservation and management measures adopted by the IATTC to control effort in the tuna purse seine fishery and reduce impacts to other species such as sea turtles, sharks, seabirds, and juvenile tunas.Time/area closures to reduce the catch of juvenile tunas.Required retention of tuna caught in the purse seine fishery.The United States has also implemented conservation and management measures adopted by the WCPFC to control juvenile tuna catch in the purse seine fishery targeting skipjack and to minimize impacts to non-target species such as sea turtles and sharks.Limits on the number of days purse seiners can spend fishing in certain areas.A seasonal prohibition on the use of fish aggregating devices by purse seine vessels.Closure of specific high seas areas in the Western and Central Pacific to purse seine vessels.A requirement for purse seine vessels to retain certain tuna species.Purse seiners fishing in the WCPFC’s management area must also carry a fishery observer and must follow specific handling requirements in case they accidentally catch a sea turtle.Under the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacific-islands/international-affairs/south-pacific-tuna-treaty\">South Pacific Tuna Treaty</a>, U.S. purse seine vessels operating throughout the Western and Central Pacific Ocean must be registered and are monitored through logbooks, cannery landing receipts, national surveillance activities, observers, and port sampling.Purse seiners in the Eastern Pacific also operate under the International Dolphin Conservation Program, a multilateral agreement aimed at reducing and minimizing bycatch of dolphins and undersize tuna.In 2000, the United States established the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/dolphin-safe\">Dolphin-Safe Tuna Tracking and Verification Program</a> to monitor the domestic production and importation of all frozen and processed tuna products nationwide and to authenticate any associated dolphin-safe claim.",

",
        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "Commercial fishery:Most of the global harvest of Pacific skipjack tuna comes from the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO).U.S. fisheries typically account for less than 10 percent of harvest from the WCPO.In 2021, commercial landings of Pacific skipjack tuna totaled 290,000 pounds and were valued at $570,000, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200::::::\">commercial fishing landings database</a> (these landings do not include skipjack tuna landed outside the U.S.).The majority of landings of non-purse seine caught skipjack tuna are in Hawaii, with some landings in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Purse seines are primarily used to catch Pacific skipjack tuna.Skipjack tuna is also caught in longline, pole-and-line, and troll fisheries.Fishing gear used to catch Pacific skipjack tuna rarely contacts the seafloor so habitat impacts are minimal.Interactions with protected species such as sea turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds in these fisheries are rare and survival rates are estimated to be high for all gear types.Many purse seine fishermen use fish aggregating devices (FADs) to target tunas.FADs can be drifting, floating or submerged objects deployed and tracked by vessels, including through the use of radio or satellite buoys, for the purpose of aggregating target tuna species.FADs are also known to attract non-target and bycatch species, including juvenile tunas, sharks, other fish, and occasionally protected species.Use of FADS is prohibited in certain areas at certain times of the year to regulate fishing effort and reduce bycatch of juvenile tunas.Longline and purse seine fishermen are trained in safe handling and release techniques for sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, and they carry and use specific equipment for handling and releasing these animals.Scientists and managers continue to monitor bycatch in these fisheries through logbooks and fishery observer programs.Recreational fishery:Recreational anglers fish for skipjack tuna with troll, rod-and-reel, and handline gear and sometimes by free-diving with spear guns.Off California, anglers must be licensed and must follow daily bag limits. Recreational charter boats must keep logbooks of their catch.There are no federal regulations for recreational fishing off Hawaii and U.S. Pacific Island territories, but local rules may apply.In 2021, recreational anglers landed 1.1 million pounds of skipjack tuna, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200::::::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>.

Depending on their size, females can produce anywhere from 1 million to 29 million eggs. They spawn multiple times throughout the year in warm tropical and sub-tropical waters.In the western North Atlantic, they spawn south of the Sargasso Sea and in the upper Caribbean from December to March, and off the southeast coast of the United States from April through August.Swordfish feed on a variety of fish and invertebrates such as squid.They capture prey by slashing their bill back and forth, stunning or injuring prey in the process.They have developed unique characteristics, such as a special eye muscles and a heat exchange system that allows them to swim in deep, cold water in search of prey.

Pacific mackerel spawn from late April to September off California, year-round off central Baja California peaking from June through October, and from late fall to early spring off Cabo San Lucas.They spawn several times a year, releasing batches of almost 70,000 eggs each time. The eggs usually hatch within 4 to 5 days.Pacific mackerel feed on plankton (tiny floating plants and animals) and the younger stages of all the pelagic species such as anchovies and sardines, as well as their own young.Various larger fish (such as sharks and tunas), marine mammals, and seabirds eat Pacific mackerel.Pacific mackerel school as a defense against predators. Often they will school with other pelagic species such as jack mackerel and sardines.As adults, they migrate north to Washington in the summer and south to Baja California in the winter. The northerly movement in summer is accentuated during El Niño events.They also travel inshore and offshore off California—they’re more abundant inshore from July to November and more abundant offshore from March to May.",

A number of fish, sharks, skates, marine mammals, and seabirds prey on herring.Atlantic herring feed on zooplankton (tiny floating animals), krill, and fish larvae.",

During the past decade, the United States has accounted for 78 percent of the total herring harvest, with Canada harvesting the remainder.The Atlantic herring fishery is extremely valuable to the economy in the Northeast United States. Herring are sold frozen, salted, or canned as sardines in both U.S. and international markets and provide affordable bait to fishermen targeting lobster, blue crab, and tuna.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Historically, Gulf of Maine herring were harvested along the coast in fixed-gear weirs (a fence of long stakes driven into the ground with nets arranged in a circle). Today, herring are primarily harvested by mid-water trawlers and purse seiners.Mid-water trawlers deploy and tow a net in the water column to catch schooling fish such as herring. The large front end of the net herds schooling fish toward the narrow back end, where they become trapped.Purse seiners catch schooling fish near the surface by encircling them with a net. When the net is around the school, fishermen lift up a wire that runs through the bottom of the net, closing the “purse” from below.Fisheries that harvest groundfish (such as cod and haddock) and herring operate in the same areas during the same seasons. Herring vessels may incidentally catch groundfish (mainly haddock). Managers set a cap on the amount of haddock that can be caught by the herring midwater trawl fishery.The Atlantic herring fishery can incidentally catch marine mammals. Currently, these takes are below limits that would require mitigation under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.Management measures to reduce marine mammal interactions include research, outreach to educate fisherman about actions they can take in the event of a marine mammal interaction, and efforts to communicate interaction hotspots to fishermen.",

Barotrauma occurs when reef fish are quickly brought to the surface by hook-and-line gear and the gas in their swimbladders overexpands. <a href=\"https://www.flseagrant.org/fisheries/venting/\" rel=\"external\">Venting tools</a> help deflate the expanded abdominal cavity, preventing serious injury to the fish and easing their return to deep water. Fish descenders help fish return to deeper waters so air in the abdomen can recompress.Fish traps, gill nets, and bottom longlines can generate bycatch. There are restrictions limiting or prohibiting the use of these gears in the South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and U.S. Caribbean to reduce bycatch.Recreational fishery:Vermilion snapper are a popular catch for recreational fishermen.In 2021, recreational anglers landed 2.6 million pounds of vermilion snapper, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:12220081225749::NO:::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>.

Using this information, they make recommendations for management of the upcoming fishing season.Their general goal is to allow fishermen to harvest the maximum amount of salmon that will support the fishery while preventing overharvest of the resource and ensuring that salmon populations with low abundance can rebuild.Specific management measures vary year to year depending on current salmon abundance, and include size limits, season length, quotas, and gear restrictions.Management of Chinook salmon must also comply with laws such as the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/laws-policies#endangered-species-act\">Endangered Species Act</a>. One of the threats to recovery of endangered Southern Resident killer whales on the West Coast is the availability of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon.

When abundance is high and the number of fish returning is much higher than that needed to meet escapement goals, harvest levels are set higher.In years of low abundance, harvest levels are lowered.During the fishing season, scientists monitor catch and escapement, comparing current returns with those from previous years, to keep an eye on abundance and actively manage the fishery.Off the West Coast and in Alaska, the <a href=\"https://www.psc.org/about-us/history-purpose/pacific-salmon-treaty/\" rel=\"external\">Pacific Salmon Treaty</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.psc.org/index.htm\" rel=\"external\">Pacific Salmon Commission</a> help coordinate management, research, and enhancement of shared U.S. and international salmon stocks, including Chinook.",

        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "Commercial fishery:The majority of U.S.-caught bigeye tuna comes from Hawaii, although a substantial amount is also harvested by U.S. purse seine vessels and landed in American Samoa or other countries for canning.In 2020, commercial landings of Pacific bigeye tuna totaled 16.7 million pounds and were valued at $56 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:28374356332900::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>. Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Fishermen based in Hawaii, American Samoa, and the U.S. Pacific Islands target Pacific bigeye tuna with hook-and-line, pelagic longline, or troll fishing gearU.S. commercial purse seine fishermen in the western and central Pacific also harvest bigeye tuna.The U.S. coastal purse seine fleet operating in the eastern Pacific Ocean typically fish off California for small pelagic species such as sardine and anchovy and sometimes catch bigeye tuna when warm water from the south brings bigeye tuna within their range.Fishing gear used to catch Pacific bigeye tuna rarely contacts the seafloor so habitat impacts are minimal.Restrictions on the type of fishing gear that can be used, and prohibitions on fishing in certain areas, minimize impacts on protected species.Interactions with protected species such as sea turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds in these fisheries are rare and survival rates are estimated to be high for all gear types.Longline fishermen are trained in safe handling and release techniques for sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, and they carry and use specific equipment for handling and releasing these animals.Scientists and managers continue to monitor bycatch in these fisheries through logbooks and fishery observer programs.Management measures are in place to minimize bycatch of juvenile Pacific bigeye tuna.Recreational fishery:Off California, anglers must be licensed and daily bag limits are in place. Recreational charter boats must keep logbooks of their catch.There are no federal regulations for recreational fishing off Hawaii and U.S. Pacific Island territories, but local rules may apply.",

Eggs are fertilized internally and develop inside the mother.Females bear live pups, which are approximately 2 feet long when born. This large size at birth helps reduce the number of potential predators and enhances the pups’ chance of survival.Mean litter size is 12, and up to 30 pups have been reported, though scientists have only examined a handful of litters.Shortfin mako sharks are aggressive predators that feed near the top of the food web on marine fishes such as bluefish, swordfish, tuna, marine mammals, and other sharks.They have few predators, mainly larger sharks that may prey on smaller shortfin mako sharks.",

        "Harvest": "In 2021, commercial landings of Atlantic common thresher shark totaled 60,000 pounds and were valued at $39,000, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:15385506747448::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>. To commercially harvest Atlantic sharks, vessel owners must obtain a valid Atlantic shark directed or incidental limited access permit or a smoothhound shark open access permit.  More information regarding limited access permits can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-fishery-compliance-guides\">Atlantic HMS fishery compliance guides</a>.Most of this catch comes from New Jersey and North Carolina. Common thresher sharks are part of the pelagic shark complex. Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Atlantic common thresher sharks are primarily caught incidentally in longline fisheries targeting swordfish and tuna. Gear used to catch common thresher sharks does not impact habitat since it does not contact the ocean floor.Fishermen are required to use circle hooks on pelagic longlines to reduce bycatch of sea turtles. All pelagic longline fishing vessels must also carry safe handling and release gear to help in returning any unintentionally caught protected species to the sea safely.Fishermen using longline or gillnet gear must complete a protected species safe handling, release, and identification <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-protected-species-safe-handling-release-and\">workshop</a>.Certain areas are closed to fishing to protect nursery areas, sensitive habitats, and populations.<a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/enforcement/regional-vessel-monitoring-information#atlantic-highly-migratory-species\">Vessel monitoring systems</a> ensure fishermen are complying with area closures.Recreational fishermen fish for common thresher sharks, mainly with rod-and-reel gear.Recreational fishermen must have an Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-permits\">HMS permit</a> to harvest Atlantic common thresher sharks in federal waters.  As of January 1, 2018, all HMS recreational permit holders will need a “shark endorsement” to fish for, retain, possess, or land sharks. In 2021, recreational anglers landed 320,000 pounds of common thresher shark, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200:11446134604799::NO:RP::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>.In addition to the shark endorsement, fishermen fishing recreationally for sharks will be required to use circle hook in most places. <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/podcast/hooked-sharks\">Circle hooks</a> are less likely to be caught in the thresher shark’s long tail, increasing the survival of sharks that are caught and released.  For more information regarding these requirements, please refer to HMS regulations and the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-fishery-compliance-guides\">Amendment 5b compliance guide</a>.​Sharks must be a minimum size to be caught, and there is a limit on how many sharks can be caught per fishing trip.",

Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Fishermen based in Hawaii, American Samoa, and the U.S. Pacific Islands target Pacific yellowfin tuna with hook-and-line, pelagic longline, or troll fishing gear. U.S. commercial purse seine fishermen in the western and central Pacific Ocean and the eastern Pacific Ocean also harvest yellowfin tuna.There is a small U.S. purse seine fleet operating in the eastern Pacific Ocean that sometimes targets Pacific yellowfin tuna when warm water from the south brings the species within their range.Fishing gear used to catch Pacific yellowfin tuna rarely contacts the seafloor so habitat impacts are minimal.Restrictions on the type of fishing gear that can be used and prohibitions on fishing in certain areas minimize impacts on protected species.Interactions with protected species such as sea turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds in these fisheries are rare and survival rates are estimated to be high for all gear types.Longline fishermen are trained in safe handling and release techniques for sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, and they carry and use specific equipment for handling and releasing these animals.Scientists and managers continue to monitor bycatch in these fisheries through logbooks and fishery observer programs.Management measures are in place to minimize bycatch of juvenile Pacific yellowfin tuna.Recreational fishery:In 2021, recreational anglers landed 2.8 million pounds of Pacific yellowfin tuna, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200::::::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>. Recreational anglers fish for yellowfin tuna with troll, rod-and-reel, and handline gear and sometimes by free-diving with spear guns.Off California, anglers must be licensed and daily bag limits are in place.

They are known to spawn in large numbers from January through March off south-central California, and were traditionally thought to migrate seasonally. However, recent studies have also shown that they may spawn as far north as Canada.In the spring, they travel nearshore and to the north to feed along the continental shelf and slope from northern California to Vancouver Island.In the summer, they form large schools along the continental shelf break. In years with warmer water temperatures, whiting tend to move farther north during the summer. Older whiting tend to migrate farther than younger fish.Female whiting are able to reproduce when they reach 2 to 4 years old (13 to 16 inches long). Males mature by 3 years of age (11 inches long).Females release their eggs, which males then fertilize externally. Eggs hatch in 5 to 6 days.They feed on shrimp, krill, and pelagic schooling fish, such as eulachon and Pacific herring. As whiting grow larger, fish make up a greater part of their diet.Many fish-eating species, such as <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/lingcod\">lingcod</a> and Humboldt squid, prey on Pacific whiting. <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/sablefish\">Sablefish</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/pacific-albacore-tuna\">albacore</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/alaska-pollock\">pollock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/pacific-cod\">Pacific cod</a>, rockfish, sharks, and marine mammals also feed on Pacific whiting.",

Females can have 500,000 to 1.5 million eggs over the spawning season. Spanish mackerel swim in large, fast-moving schools.They migrate as the seasons and water temperatures change.Along the Atlantic coast, Spanish mackerel spend the winter off Florida and move northward to North Carolina in early April and to New York in June. As waters cool later in the year, they return south to Florida waters.In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, they migrate to the west of Cape San Blas, Florida. They remain in the northern Gulf of Mexico until September and migrate south along the coast in the fall.Spanish mackerel prey primarily on herring, menhaden, sardines, mullet, needlefish, and anchovy and, to a lesser degree, shrimp, crabs, and squid. They are often seen forcing schools of small fish into tight bundles and nearly pushing them out of the water when feeding.Dolphins and sharks prey on Spanish mackerel. ",

Commercial landings of Spanish mackerel have generally been increasing in the Atlantic over the past decade.  Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Commercial fishermen use cast nets, gillnets, and hook-and-line gear to harvest Spanish mackerel. Cast nets account for the majority of landings.Spanish mackerel are caught in coastal waters at or near the surface, so fishing gear has minimal impacts on habitat.Fishermen throw cast nets and set gillnets directly on schools of Spanish mackerel, so they rarely catch other species.Hook-and-line fisheries for mackerel are selective and have little bycatch.Recreational fishery:In 2021, recreational harvest of Spanish mackerel totaled 16.8 million pounds.Recreational catches of Spanish mackerel in the South Atlantic have remained stable while those in the Gulf of Mexico have decreased in recent years.Spanish mackerel is an important species for recreational fishermen, who often use them as bait for big game fishing.Recreational management measures include:Minimum size limits.Limits on the number of mackerel fishermen can catch. Spanish mackerel must be landed with their heads and fins intact.Charter vessel/headboat operators must have a vessel permit for coastal migratory fish and must comply with possession limits.",

Females release eggs in the open water, where they are fertilized.Females grow much larger than males, an evolutionary strategy that maximizes the amount of eggs that a female can produce. Females can produce 50,000 to several million eggs.King mackerel are carnivores, feeding on fish, squid, and shrimp. They’re voracious feeders and have been observed leaping out of the water in pursuit of prey.Juvenile and larger pelagic fish feed on smaller king mackerel. Bottlenose dolphins and large fish, such as sharks and tunas, feed on adult king mackerel. ",

Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Commercial fishermen mainly use bottom trawls to harvest summer flounder, fishing offshore in the winter and inshore in the summer.Bottom trawls contact the bottom and can impact bottom habitats. However, summer flounder are most common on sandy ocean bottoms, which are more resilient than other habitat types to the impacts of fishing gear.Bottom trawls can unintentionally catch sea turtles. Since 1992, all vessels fishing for summer flounder with bottom trawls off Virginia and North Carolina have been required to use NOAA Fisheries–approved <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/southeast/bycatch/turtle-excluder-devices\">turtle excluder devices (TEDs)</a> in their nets. A TED is a sorting grid that is sewn into a trawl net to allow fish to pass through to the back of the net while preventing larger animals, such as turtles and sharks, from passing through by allowing them to escape through flaps above or below the TED.Management measures also require the mesh on fishing nets to be a certain size to prevent bycatch of juvenile summer flounder and other species.Recreational fishery:Summer flounder are one of the most popular recreational fish on the Atlantic coast.In 2021, recreational landings were 6.8 million pounds, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200:6228678179267::NO:::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>.Anglers fish for summer flounder from the shore, piers, and boats with hook-and-line gear.The recreational harvest limits for each state are based on the recreational catch in 1998.Regulations for the recreational fishery are typically adjusted annually.

Red grouper are unspecialized and opportunistic feeders – they eat any convenient prey. They engulf prey whole by opening their large mouths, dilating their gill covers, rapidly drawing in a current of water, and inhaling the food.Smaller grouper are preyed on by the same predators that eat snappers, including jacks, other groupers, sharks, barracudas, and morays.

Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Commercial fishermen mainly use hook-and-line gear, including longlines and handlines, to harvest red grouper. Trawl gear, fish traps, and bottom longlines are prohibited in some areas to reduce bycatch. Several areas are closed to all fishing to protect snappers and groupers, including red grouper.Sea turtles and other reef fishes, such as snappers and groupers, can be incidentally caught while fishing for red grouper. In certain areas, fishermen are required to use circle hooks to improve the chance of survival of any unintentionally caught fish and to reduce turtle hookings. Commercial and charterboat/headboat reef fish fishermen must use appropriate release gear and follow handling protocols to increase the chance of survival for any incidentally caught <a href=\"http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/gulf_sa/turtle_sawfish_release/index.html\">sea turtles</a>.

Females can live for more than 20 years, 4 years longer than males.Males are able to reproduce when they reach 2 years old. Females mature starting at 3 years old.They spawn from winter to early spring over soft muddy ocean floors in water 165 to 230 feet deep.Depending on their size, females release between 150,000 and 2 million eggs. Eggs sink to the bottom a few days after spawning. Larvae stay near the surface for about 2 to 3 months before they are transported by wind and tidal streams to nearshore and estuarine nursery areas – an uncommon characteristic for a flatfish species in this region. Juveniles spend 1 to 2 years developing in nursery areas before migrating out to deeper waters, typically in late May.Larvae feed on plankton (tiny floating plants and animals).Juvenile and adult English sole feed on crustaceans, worms, small bivalves, clam siphons, and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates.English sole feed during the day using sight and smell, and sometimes dig for their prey.Seabirds, larger fishes, and marine mammals prey on juveniles. Marine mammals, sharks, and other large fish prey on adults. ",

        "Biology": "Caribbean spiny lobsters grow by molting – they vacate their old shells while simultaneously absorbing water, expanding their body size. They molt about 25 times in their first 5 to 7 years of life, and once per year when they’re older. It takes them about 2 years to grow to the 3-inch carapace (shell) legal-harvesting size.Spiny lobsters may live 15 years or more, but there is uncertainty regarding this estimate due to the difficulty in ageing this species.They can grow up to 15 pounds and 18 inches.Females can reproduce when they reach 2.75 to 3 inches carapace length in the southeastern United States, and 3.6 inches in the Caribbean.They spawn from March through August in the Florida Keys on offshore reefs, and spawn throughout the year in the Caribbean.The male spiny lobster deposits sperm packets on the underside of the female. She scratches them to release sperm as she releases her eggs (between 230,000 to 2.6 million eggs each time they spawn, depending on her size). The female carries the fertilized eggs beneath her tail, and is referred to as “berried.” The eggs hatch in about 3 weeks.Most of the spiny lobster larvae found in U.S. waters are from upstream sources in the Caribbean.Young spiny lobsters feed on soft-bodied plankton (tiny floating plants and animals).Juveniles and adults are carnivores, preying on snails, crabs, and clams. They are nocturnal, inhabiting coral reefs, burrows, and dens during the day and foraging for food at night.Many predators feed on juvenile and adult spiny lobster, including groupers, snappers, sharks, skates, turtles, and octopuses.",

Gear types, habitat, and bycatch:Commercial fishermen harvest spiny lobsters either by diving, bullynetting, or using wooden, plastic, or metal traps.Bullynetting is conducted in shallow waters at night when lobster are foraging for food or migrating offshore. A vessel uses a spotlight to find the lobster and then uses a “bullynet” to harvest the lobster.Buoys are attached to each trap, or if stringing a trap line, at each end of the trap line. Commercial traps are weighted with cement and must have a degradable escape panel to prevent “ghost fishing” (when a lost or abandoned trap continues to capture lobsters or other species).The State of Florida runs <a href=\"https://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/trap-debris/\" rel=\"external\">two programs</a> dedicated to removing lost and abandoned traps from state waters and has the authority to expand those programs into federal waters.Fishermen generally use undersized lobster (known as “shorts”) as bait to attract legal-sized lobsters into their traps. Mortality of these undersized lobsters is around 10 percent.Traps sometimes incidentally catch reef fish and ornamental fish, but most are released alive. Threatened or endangered species, such as sea turtles and corals, occasionally become entangled in trap lines.Recreational anglers harvest spiny lobsters primarily by snorkeling or scuba diving. Undersized lobsters must be released unharmed immediately without removal from water. ",

They move into inshore waters off the U.S. Pacific coast by late summer, then spend late fall and winter in the western Pacific Ocean. The timing and distance of their migrations in a given year depend on oceanic conditions.Less is known about the movements of albacore in the South Pacific Ocean – juveniles move southward from the tropics when they are about a foot long, and then eastward to about 130˚ West. When the fish are mature, they return to tropical and subtropical waters to spawn.They’re able to reproduce when they reach 5 to 6 years old, and they live for 10 to 12 years.North Pacific albacore spawn between March and July in tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific. Females broadcast their eggs near the surface, where they’re fertilized. Depending on their size, females release between 800,000 and 2.6 million eggs every time they spawn.Albacore can swim at speeds exceeding 50 miles per hour and cover vast areas during annual migrations.They have a highly evolved circulatory system that regulates their body temperature and increases muscle efficiency; a high metabolism; and high blood pressure, volume, and hemoglobin, all of which increase oxygen absorption.They lack the structures needed to pump oxygen-rich water over their gills so, in order to breathe, they must constantly swim with their mouths open.Albacore are top carnivores, preying on schooling stocks such as sardine, anchovy, and squid. They eat an enormous amount of food to fuel their high metabolism, sometimes consuming as much as 25 percent of their own weight every day.Larger species of billfish, tuna, and sharks eat albacore.",

They have determinate growth and reach maximum shell length before sexual maturation; thereafter the shell grows only in thickness. Size at maturity can vary depending on environmental conditions. Queen conch have a protracted spawning season of 4 to 9 months, with peak spawning during warmer months. They reproduce through internal fertilization, meaning individuals must be in contact to mate. Females can store fertilized eggs for several weeks, and eggs may be fertilized by multiple males. Egg laying takes 24 to 36 hours, with each egg mass containing about 750,000 eggs. After an incubation period of about 5 days the eggs hatch, and the veligers (larvae) drift in the water column from 21 to 30 days before settling to the bottom and metamorphosing into the adult form. Queen conch are slow moving marine snails that require direct contact to mate and these life history traits make them vulnerable to depensatory processes  which impact reproductive success and impedes recovery of depleted populations. Larval conch feed on phytoplankton, juvenile conch feed primarily on seagrass detritus macroalgae and organic material in the sediment, and adults feed primarily on different types of filamentous algae.",

After molting they are soft and vulnerable to predators until their new shell hardens.Red king crabs eat almost anything they can find and crush with their claws.Smaller crabs eat algae, small worms, small clams, and other small animals.Larger crabs eat a much wider range of items including worms, clams, mussels, barnacles, crabs, fish, sea stars, sand dollars, and brittle stars.Smaller crabs are eaten by a variety of groundfish, octopi, sea otters, and crabs, including other red king crabs.Large red king crabs have few predators except right after molting.

State regulations must comply with the fishery management plan, the national standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable federal laws:The red king crab fishery is currently managed according to the “three S’s”—size, sex, and season. Only male crabs of a certain size may be harvested, and fishing is not allowed during mating and molting periods. These measures help ensure that crabs are able to reproduce and replace the ones that are harvested. Fishermen must install escape panels and rings on their pots to prevent ghost fishing (when lost pots continue to capture and kill species) and to reduce bycatch.Every year, managers set the harvest limit for the next fishing season using the most recent estimates of crab abundance. Managers allocate shares of the harvest among harvesters, processors, and coastal communities through the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/bering-sea-and-aleutian-islands-bsai-crab-fisheries\">crab rationalization program</a>, which was implemented in 2005 to address economic, safety, and environmental issues in the fishery. This program includes a <a href=\"https://www.npfmc.org/community-development-program/\">community development quota</a>, which protects community interests by allowing community groups a percentage of the harvest. They’re given the opportunity to purchase shares in the fishery before the shares are offered for sale outside the community. Vessels carry vessel monitoring systems (satellite communications systems used to monitor fishing activities) and must report their landings electronically.Managers monitor catch in real time and are able to close the fishery when the harvest limit is reached.Observers are required on 20 percent of the vessels in the fishery. They collect data on catch and bycatch and document any violations of fishing regulations.Fishing has been closed for red king crab in the Pribilof Islands and Western Aleutian Islands for many years.",
        "Fishing Rate": "The Pribilof Islands and Bristol Bay stocks are closed to fishing. None of the stocks are subject to overfishing.",
        "Habitat Impacts": "Habitat impacts from crab pots are minor because fishing occurs in areas of soft sediment, such as silt and mud, which are unlikely to be damaged by fishing gear.",
        "Habitat": "Juveniles less than 2 years old live in shallow waters in complex habitats, such as shell hash, cobble, algae, and bryozoans (branching, coral-like invertebrates) to avoid being preyed upon by fish and other crabs.Older juveniles form pods that travel together, mounding up during the day and feeding at night.Pods can consist of tens of thousands of individual crabs and are likely an anti-predator strategy, similar to schooling in fish.Mature animals move into deeper water (typically less than 650 feet along the continental shelf) to feed, and the females return to shallow waters to hatch their eggs.",
        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "In 2021, commercial landings of all king crab in Alaska totaled 6 million pounds and were valued at more than $73 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:15293554151240::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>.Red king crab are mainly harvested in Bristol Bay. Some catch also comes from fisheries in Norton Sound.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Mesh-covered pots that are 7 to 8 square feet are used to catch red king crab.Only male crabs can legally be caught and sold.Crab pots can unintentionally catch female crabs (which may not be harvested), males under the comm ercial size, and non-targeted crab species as well as a small number of other species including octopus, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, other flatfish, sponges, coral, and sea stars.Regulations require fishermen to install escape panels and rings on their pots to prevent ghost fishing (when lost pots continue to capture and kill species) and to reduce bycatch.Habitat impacts from the red king crab fishery are minor because fishing occurs in areas of soft sediment such as silt and mud. Soft sediments are unlikely to be damaged by fishing gear. Crab pots are less damaging than mobile gear because they are stationary and contact a much smaller area of the seafloor.Fishing has been closed for red king crab in the Pribilof Islands since 1999 to avoid bycatch of the overfished Pribilof Islands blue king crab. Fishing for the Bristol Bay stock was closed for the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 fishing seasons because of a low abundance of mature females.",

They tend to move shallower during the day and deeper at night.Males are generally found in shallower water than females, except for pregnant females that enter shallow bays to pup.Immature juveniles live in the water column near the surface. As they grow older, they settle to the bottom.Spiny dogfish often travel in large schools, largely to protect themselves from predators, and avidly feed during their journeys. The schools include hundreds, if not thousands, of dogfish and tend to divide up according to size and gender, although the young—both male and female—tend to stay together.They can travel long distances – a spiny dogfish tagged in Queen Charlotte Sound (off British Columbia) was recovered off the northeast coast of Japan years later.",

Nearly all shark catch is discarded at sea, but some spiny dogfish are retained as incidental catch in state-managed fisheries.Spiny dogfish are generally not targeted by anglers off the Pacific coast or Alaska. However, due to their aggressive feeding nature, spiny dogfish tend to bite baited hooks and are incidentally caught in many recreational fisheries.Off the Pacific coast, spiny dogfish are considered a bottomfish so they are restricted by the recreational coastwide aggregate limit (although most are released because they’re not highly valued) as well as all other applicable bottomfish recreational restrictions (depth, season, etc.).In Alaska, anglers have annual bag limits for sharks of any kind.",

Ampullae of Lorenzini are organs around the mouth that are filled with fluids that help neurons detect changes in electromagnetic fields generated by movements of prey. Some researchers have also theorized that the bottom-dwelling elasmobranchs use electromagnetic fields generated from changes in sea floor substrate to assist with migration patterns.Because spiny dogfish have skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone, they have a different mechanism for producing what are referred to as “B” (bone marrow) cells in bony vertebrates. In elasmobranchs, these cells are generated outside the skeleton, instead of in the bone marrow. Studying this phenomenon, as well as dogfish renal glands (which produce certain compounds shown to have some success in combating HIV virus particles and cancer cells), may have value in the development of future biomedical treatment therapies for humans.<a href=\"https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/ABL/MESA/mesa_sa_sharks.php\">NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center Shark Research</a>",

        "Biology": "Pacific halibut are one of the largest flatfish – they can weigh up to about 500 pounds and grow to more than 8 feet long.Males tend to be smaller than females.Males sexually mature when they are 8 years old, and females are able to reproduce by the age of 12.They spawn during the winter in deep water along the continental slope, mainly in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, and south to British Columbia.Depending on their size, females can have between 500,000 and 4 million eggs.Scientists believe females release their eggs in batches over several days during the spawning season. Eggs hatch after 12 to 20 days, dependent on water temperature.The larvae slowly float close to the surface, where they remain for about 6 months until they reach their adult form and settle to the bottom in shallow water.Larval Pacific halibut feed on zooplankton (tiny floating organisms).Juveniles eat small crustaceans and other organisms that live on the seafloor.Halibut live to be relatively old – the oldest halibut on record was 55 years old, but halibut over age 25 are rare.Adults aggressively prey on a variety of groundfish, sculpins, sand lance, herring, octopus, crabs, clams, and occasionally smaller Pacific halibut.Marine mammals and sharks sometimes eat Pacific halibut but, due to their large size, adult Pacific halibut are rarely preyed upon by other fish.",

        "Fishery Management": "Since 1923, the United States and Canada have coordinated Pacific halibut management through a bilateral commission known as the <a href=\"https://www.iphc.int/\" rel=\"external\">International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC)</a>. NOAA Fisheries and the <a href=\"https://www.npfmc.org/\">North Pacific</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcouncil.org/\">Pacific Fishery Management Councils</a> are responsible for allocating allowable catch among harvesters in the U.S. fisheries.IPHC:Using the latest scientific information on the abundance and potential yield of the Pacific halibut stock, establishes catch limits annually for fisheries in U.S. and Canadian waters.Sets the catch limits at a level that will ensure the long-term welfare of the Pacific halibut stock.Sets the dates for the fishing season, which usually spans from March to November and is closed the rest of the year when Pacific halibut spawn.The commercial fishery has a minimum size requirement to protect juvenile Pacific halibut.In Alaska, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council is responsible for allocating the catch limits among users and user groups fishing off Alaska and developing regulations for the fishery, in line with IPHC recommendations. <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/region/alaska\">NOAA Fisheries</a> is responsible for implementing and enforcing these regulations:<a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/pacific-halibut-and-sablefish-individual-fishing-quota-ifq-program\">Individual fishing quota program</a>, which allocates the total allowable catch among fishing vessels and individual fishermen. With their catch set, fishermen have the flexibility to harvest their quota anytime, creating a safer, more efficient, more valuable, and environmentally responsible fishery.<a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/sustainable-fisheries/community-development-quota-cdq-program\">Community development quota program</a>, which allocates a percentage of the total allowable catch to eligible western Alaska villages to allow them to participate and invest in fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands and to support sustainable economic and community development in western Alaska.For waters off the U.S. West Coast, the Pacific Fishery Management Council is responsible for allocating the catch limits among users and user groups fishing off the West Coast and developing regulations for the fishery, in line with Commission recommendations. <a href=\"http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/\">NOAA Fisheries</a> is responsible for implementing and enforcing these regulations:Establish regulations for Pacific halibut fisheries in U.S. waters off Washington, Oregon, and California (known as IPHC Regulatory Area 2A).The IPHC sets the catch limit for Pacific halibut in this regulatory area, and the Pacific Council allocates the catch among the following user groups: non-tribal commercial (incidental salmon troll fishery, directed longline Pacific halibut fishery, and incidental longline sablefish fishery), sport, and treaty Indian commercial and ceremonial-and-subsistence.The Pacific Council describes the division of Pacific halibut catch each year in the Pacific Halibut Catch Sharing Plan for Area 2A.",
        "Fishing Rate": "Not subject to overfishing.",
        "Habitat Impacts": "Fishing gears used to harvest Pacific halibut have minimal impacts on habitat.",
        "Habitat": "Juveniles (1 inch and larger) live in shallow, near-shore waters off Alaska and British Columbia.Pacific halibut move to deeper water as they age.Adults migrate seasonally from shallow summer feeding grounds to deeper winter spawning grounds.",
        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "Commercial fishery:In 2021, commercial landings of Pacific halibut totaled 25 million pounds and were valued at $120 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200:12261558388582::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>. Approximately 95 percent of this harvest was landed in Alaska.Pacific halibut is one of the most valuable commercial and recreational fishery resources in the North Pacific Ocean.About 2 percent of the halibut population that can be fished is found off Oregon and Washington, about 15 percent off British Columbia, and the remainder off Alaska.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Historically, only hook-and-line gear was allowed to target Pacific halibut. In recent years, vessels fishing with pot gear in certain areas or fisheries may retain Pacific halibut although this has been at very low levels.Commercial fishermen predominantly use bottom longlines (setlines), which minimally impact habitat.Setlines can incidentally catch seabirds, but widespread use of seabird avoidance devices (called streamers) in the fishery has reduced seabird bycatch by up to 90 percent per vessel.In general, the commercial Pacific halibut fishery is fairly selective in the fish it catches because of the size of hook needed to harvest such a large fish. Using a large hook generally reduces bycatch of smaller fish.Fishermen use circle hooks to increase catch rates, and these hooks also improve the survival of any undersized Pacific halibut caught and released.Pacific halibut are also caught in commercial fisheries targeting other species. Regulations, such as gear and fishery restrictions, are in place to reduce bycatch of Pacific halibut in those fisheries.Sport fishery:Pacific halibut is a popular target for sport fishermen.The <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/recreational-fishing/sport-fishing-alaska\">sport fishery in Alaska</a> is managed under daily bag and possession limits.Sport fishermen often fish for Pacific halibut from charter (party) boats, which accounts for 55 percent of the total recreational harvest in Alaska.The charter fishery has more restrictive regulations to keep its harvest within the levels set by managers, including a permit system that limits the number of charter boats that can fish for Pacific halibut.Oregon, Washington, and California have catch limits for sport Pacific halibut fishing. The demand for Pacific halibut sport fishing is so high that closed seasons, bag limits, and possession limits are all used to control the recreational fishery and extend the season as long as possible.Tribal fisheries:Pacific halibut is an important source of spiritual and physical sustenance for Western Indian tribes and Alaska natives, and is caught in ceremonial and subsistence fisheries.Tribal commercial fisheries for Pacific halibut use similar gear types to non-tribal commercial fisheries, although allocations between tribes and fisheries and fishing season details are set both by individual tribes and through cooperative management programs bridging multiple tribes.",

Annual harvests have consistently been below this level.<a href=\"https://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/\">NOAA Fisheries</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pcouncil.org/\">Pacific Fishery Management Council</a> manage the arrowtooth flounder fishery on the West Coast.Managed under the <a href=\"https://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/fishery-management-plan/\">Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan</a>:Limits on the number of <a href=\"https://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/fisheries/management/groundfish_permits/limited_entry_permits.html\">permits</a> and fishermen allowed.Limits on the minimum size of fish that may be harvested.Limit on how much may be harvested in one fishing trip.Certain seasons and <a href=\"https://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/fisheries/management/groundfish_closures/groundfish_closed_areas.html\">areas</a> are closed to fishing.Gear restrictions help reduce bycatch and impacts on habitat.A <a href=\"https://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/fisheries/groundfish_catch_shares/index.html\">trawl rationalization catch share program</a> includes:Catch limits based on population information for each fish stock and divided into shares that are allocated to individual fishermen or groups.These fishermen can decide how and when to catch their share—preferably when weather, markets, and business conditions are most favorable, allowing the fishery the flexibility to be more environmentally responsible, safer, more efficient, and more valuable.",
        "Fishing Rate": "Not subject to overfishing.",
        "Habitat Impacts": "Area closures and gear restrictions protect habitats affected by some types of fishing gear used to harvest arrowtooth flounder.",
        "Habitat": "Juvenile and adult arrowtooth flounder live on the ocean floor.They’re most commonly found on sand or sandy gravel habitat and occasionally over low-relief rock-sponge bottoms.During the summer, arrowtooth flounder feed in shallow water on the continental shelf.They migrate to deep water over the continental slope to spawn in the winter.",
        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "In 2021, commercial landings of arrowtooth flounder totaled 36 million pounds and were valued at $3.8 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:4273842543681::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>. Although arrowtooth flounder are a low-value fish, fishermen have been retaining more of the arrowtooth they catch – up to about 80 percent in Alaska.Catches have been higher because arrowtooth flounder are more abundant, resulting in higher incidental catch in other fisheries, in addition to increased marketing efforts for arrowtooth fish meal and surimi.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Bottom trawl gear is used to catch arrowtooth flounder.In general, arrowtooth flounder live on sandy or sand/gravel habitats. These soft bottom habitats are usually more resilient than other habitats to trawling impacts.In Alaska, NOAA Fisheries scientists and the flatfish fishing industry collaborated to develop changes to fishing gear that would reduce effects of flatfish trawling on seafloor habitats of the central Gulf of Alaska and the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The modified gear they developed – <a href=\"https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/Quarterly/jfm2010/jfm10featurelead.htm\">Bering Sea flatfish gear</a> – not only reduced impacts to sea floor habitat and the animals living there but also reduced the fishery’s impacts on crabs. In the central Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea areas, flatfish fishermen are now required to use this modified fishing gear.Halibut are sometimes incidentally caught, but there is a limit on the number of halibut that can be incidentally caught in the fishery. When this limit is reached, the directed fishery is closed.Some rockfish are still unintentionally caught, but management caps the amount of rockfish that can be incidentally caught in the fishery.To protect sensitive fish habitat off the West Coast, gear restrictions <a href=\"https://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/fisheries/groundfish/groundfish_closed_areas.html\">limit where flatfish fishermen can fish</a>.",

After molting snow crabs are soft and vulnerable to predators until their new shell hardens.When they have reached sexual maturity, both females and males undergo a “terminal molt,” after which they never molt again.Snow crabs will eat almost anything they can catch and break open with their claws, including fish, shrimp, crabs, worms, clams, brittle stars, snails, algae, and sponges.

State regulations must comply with the fishery management plan, the national standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable federal laws:The Alaska snow crab fishery is currently managed according to the “three S’s” – size, sex, and season. Only male crabs of a certain size may be harvested, and fishing is not allowed during mating and molting periods. These measures help ensure that crabs are able to reproduce and replace the ones that are harvested.Every year, managers set the harvest limit for the next fishing season using the most recent estimates of crab abundance.Managers allocate shares of the harvest among harvesters, processors, and coastal communities through the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/bering-sea-and-aleutian-islands-bsai-crab-rationalization-program\">crab rationalization program</a>, which was implemented in 2005 to address economic, safety, and environmental issues in the fishery.

They bury themselves in the ocean floor and pump oxygen-filled water and food particles in through their siphons, which extend above the surface of the ocean floor.They feed on microscopic algae.Many animals prey on juvenile ocean quahogs, including invertebrates such as rock crabs, sea stars, and other crustaceans, and fish such as longhorn sculpin, ocean pout, haddock, and cod.Once ocean quahogs have reached a certain size, they have a very low predation rate.

Commercial fishermen harvest ocean quahogs with hydraulic clam dredges, which use jets of water to dislodge ocean quahogs from the sandy ocean floor.A smaller “dry” dredge (without hydraulic jets) is used in Maine waters.Ocean quahogs burrow into sandy bottoms on the continental shelf, an environment that is thought to recover quickly after a hydraulic clam dredge passes over it.The bars on commercial clam dredges are spaced several inches apart so they do not collect anything but the targeted quahogs.The quahog fishery is managed under an individual transferable quota program that slows the pace of the fishery and increases its efficiency, significantly reducing bycatch.",

Species of Alexandrium cause HABs in New England that are commonly referred to as “red tides.” Alexandrium toxin becomes concentrated in shellfish such as quahogs. The shellfish themselves are not affected by the toxin, but eating shellfish tainted with this toxin can lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a potentially fatal human illness. There are large-scale monitoring programs all along the coast to assess toxin levels in shellfish; if toxins are detected these areas are immediately closed to harvesting. Contamination from PSP has had a huge impact on fisheries for ocean quahogs. Georges Bank, where ocean quahogs are abundant, has been closed to fishing since 1990 due to the presence of PSP toxins in quahog tissue. In January 2013, a portion of Georges Bank was reopened to the harvest of ocean quahogs and surfclams by vessels using a new PSP testing protocol that was developed through the collaborative efforts of industry, scientists, and managers. This will allow safe harvest of these abundant Georges Bank resources.",

Male gray triggerfish establish territories, build nests in the sand, and entice females into the nest to spawn. The male and female tightly circle one another in the nest, rapidly changing color, and the female deposits eggs in the nest shortly afterward.Females deposit an average of 772,415 eggs. After fertilization females aerate the eggs by fanning and blowing on them.One male can defend up to three active nests on one reef. An active nest is defined as one female on the nest guarding and aerating the eggs. Females also guard the nest from predators, such as wrasses, groupers, and red snappers.Eggs hatch within 24 to 48 hours and the larvae travel to the surface, where they often live among mats of planktonic (open ocean) <em>Sargassum, </em>a floating brown algae.Larvae and juveniles spend 4 to 7 months in the planktonic environment before they move to the ocean bottom.Adults primarily eat benthic invertebrates including crabs, sea urchins, shrimp, sand dollars, lobsters, and mollusks. They have a small mouth with a strong jaw and specialized teeth used to crush and chisel holes in their hard-shelled prey. Gray triggerfish sometimes direct a stream of water over sandy ocean bottom habitat to expose sand dollars to eat. Juvenile gray triggerfish feed on hydroids, barnacles, and polychaetes.Amberjack, grouper, and sharks prey upon adult gray triggerfish; tuna, dolphinfish, marlin, sailfish, and sharks prey upon juvenile gray triggerfish.",

Fisheries for black sea bass change seasonally with the species’ migrations.Of the gear utilized within the snapper grouper fishery, only the black sea bass pot is considered to pose an entanglement risk to marine mammals.When the fish are inshore, commercial fishermen catch them primarily with fish pots (both baited and unbaited) and handlines.Once the fish move offshore in the winter, they’re caught in the trawl fishery that primarily targets summer flounder, scup, and longfin squid.In the South Atlantic, fishermen use pots and sometimes handlines.Fish bycatch in the pot fishery is minor because the gear is often not baited (black sea bass are drawn to the structure and enter the pots without bait), and the pot mesh size is regulated to select fish at or above the minimum size limit.Recreational fishery Recreational fishermen use handlines to catch black sea bass.In 2021, recreational anglers landed 12.6 million pounds of black sea bass, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200:1541783939502::NO:::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>.

The rest is allocated among the various fishing sectors based on gear type, vessel size, and ability to process their catch.In the Gulf of Alaska, Being Sea, and Aleutian Islands:Fishermen must have a permit to participate in these fisheries, and the number of available permits is limited to control the amount of fishing.Managers determine how much Pacific cod can be caught and then allocate this catch quota among groups of fishermen.

        "Fishing Rate": "Not subject to overfishing.",
        "Habitat Impacts": "Area closures and gear restrictions protect habitat that are affected by some types of fishing gear used to harvest Pacific cod.",
        "Habitat": "During the winter, Pacific cod live on the continental shelf edge and upper continental slope in waters 300 to more than 800 feet deep.In the summer, they move to shallower water (300 feet deep or less).Larvae and small juveniles are found throughout the water column, while large juveniles and adults live near the ocean floor and prefer habitats of mud, sand, and clay.",
        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "Commercial fishery:Pacific cod is the second largest commercial groundfish catch off Alaska and virtually all of the United States.In 2021, commercial harvest of Pacific cod totaled 330.4 million pounds, and was worth $86.5 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:14165933430294::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>. Most Pacific cod comes from the Bering and Barents Seas and the Gulf of Alaska and is harvested by the United States, Canada, Russia, and Korea.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Pacific cod are typically harvested along with several different groundfish species with longlines (hook-and-line) and bottom trawl gear.Pots (or traps) and jig gear are also used to catch Pacific cod.In the Gulf of Alaska the dominant gear has been pots, in the Aleutian Islands trawl gear is predominantly used, and in the Bering Sea longline gear is used most frequently.Bottom trawl vessels cause minimal damage when targeting Pacific cod over soft ocean bottoms. Trawls can have negative impacts in areas where Pacific cod are associated with living structural habitats, such as corals and sea whips.Some areas are closed to certain gear types to protect sensitive habitat and organisms.In Alaska, measures restricting the type of gear fishermen may use and when and where they may fish reduce bycatch of other species in the Alaska Pacific cod fisheries.There are limits on the amount of Pacific halibut that can be incidentally caught in trawl and hook-and-line fisheries. Longlines are known to catch seabirds incidentally, but current <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/bycatch/seabird-bycatch-alaska\">measures</a> are reducing seabird bycatch.On the West Coast, area closures, reduced trip limits, non-retention rules, gear restrictions, and variable catch limits are used to help minimize impacts to overfished rockfish and prevent bycatch.Recreational fishery:Recreational fishing for Pacific cod in Alaska is minor compared to commercial fishing and mainly takes place in state waters (within 3 miles of shore). Recreational fishermen follow state regulations.",

Scientists believe that the females briefly visit these spawning areas during winter and spring and only stay long enough to deposit their eggs in crevices and under ledges.Males guard the nests for 8 to 10 weeks until the eggs hatch. The presence of a male to guard the nest from predators appears essential for successful spawning. If something happens to the male, an unguarded nest can be decimated within 48 hours by feeding rockfish, starfish, sculpins, kelp greenling, and cod.Larvae feed on zooplankton (tiny floating animals), including krill and larval crustaceans such as lobster and crab.

Species of <em>Alexandrium</em> cause HABs in New England that are commonly referred to as “red tides.” <em>Alexandrium</em> toxin becomes concentrated in shellfish such as surfclams. The shellfish themselves are not affected by the toxin, but eating shellfish tainted with this toxin can lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a potentially fatal human illness. There are large-scale monitoring programs all along the coast to assess toxin levels in shellfish; if toxins are detected these areas are immediately closed to harvesting. Contamination from PSP has had a huge impact on fisheries for surfclams. Georges Bank, where almost a third of the surfclam stock is found, has been closed to fishing since 1990 due to the presence of PSP toxins in surfclam meats. In January 2013, a portion of Georges Bank was reopened to the harvest of surfclams and ocean quahogs by vessels using a new PSP testing protocol that was developed through the collaborative efforts of industry, scientists, and managers.

Mako sharks may be caught in this fishery.NOAA Fisheries works with the federally appointed <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-take-reduction-plans-and-teams\">Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team</a> to develop measures that reduce the impacts of this fishery on certain marine mammals.Fishermen must use acoustic devices that emit high-pitched noises to deter marine mammals, and net extenders to increase minimum fishing depth on drift gillnet gear, to protect marine mammals.Off Hawaii, gear restrictions and area closures help minimize impacts to sharks, marlins, and protected species that can be caught in longline gear. Safe handling techniques help reduce impacts on sea turtles and seabirds caught in the longline fishery in Hawaii. Scientists and managers continue to monitor bycatch in these fisheries through logbooks and vessel observer programs.  Shortfin mako are considered one of the great game fish of the world and are a popular catch in shark tournaments. Recreational charter vessel operators must keep logbooks documenting their catch, and there is a limit on the number of mako sharks recreational fishermen can catch.",

They can migrate thousands of miles across an entire ocean.Tagging studies have indicated that bluefin tuna move across the east/west boundary in the Atlantic.They tend to spawn in the same areas in the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "Harvest Type": "Wild",
        "Harvest": "ICCAT implemented harvest quotas for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock in 1982. Since then, catch has been relatively stable.U.S. catch comprises about half of the total western Atlantic bluefin tuna catch and less than 10 percent of Atlantic-wide bluefin tuna catch (including the Mediterranean Sea).Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:U.S. fishermen harvest bluefin tuna with handgear (rod-and-reel, handline, and harpoon) and purse seines.Although fishermen are not allowed to use pelagic longline gear in the United States to target bluefin tuna directly, regulations allow them to retain a limited number of bluefin tuna caught incidentally while fishing for other species such as swordfish and yellowfin tuna.Fishermen generally target schools of bluefin tuna, and their fishing gear is fairly selective and allows for the live release of any unintentionally caught species.Fishing gear used to catch bluefin tuna rarely contacts the ocean floor and therefore has minimal impact on habitat.NOAA Fisheries requires U.S. commercial fishermen who fish for yellowfin tuna, swordfish, and other species with pelagic longlines in the Gulf of Mexico to use <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/pelagic-longline-bluefin-tuna-area-based-and-weak-hook-management-measures?_ga=2.238997636.549089982.1598880613-1749182424.1566822859\">weak hooks</a>, a type of hook designed to reduce the incidental catch and bycatch of Atlantic bluefin tuna.Fishing for bluefin tuna in two known hotspots—Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and the Gulf of Mexico—is strictly regulated.Commercial harvest:In 2021, commercial landings of Atlantic bluefin tuna totaled 2.2 million pounds and were valued at $11.7 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200:12117512594705::NO:::\">commercial fishing landings database</a>. Ex-vessel prices depend on a number of factors, including the quality of the fish (e.g., freshness, fat content, method of storage), the weight of the fish, the supply of fish, and consumer demand.Exports vary from year to year. The majority of exported U.S. Atlantic Bluefin tuna catch is sent  to sushi markets in Japan. Exports of Atlantic bluefin tuna generally depend on the amount of commercial landings and Japanese yen/U.S. dollar exchange rates.Recreational U.S. fishery:Recreationally-caught bluefin tuna may not be sold.Bluefin tuna must be larger than 27 inches to be retained.Depending on the recreational fishery (e.g., private vessels and charter/headboat vessels), limits on the amount and size of fish that fishermen can keep per fishing trip vary. For the latest information on current retention limits, visit the <a href=\"https://hmspermits.noaa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">NOAA Fisheries HMS Permit Shop</a>.All released bluefin tuna must be released without removing the fish from the water and in a manner that will maximize its survival.Recreational fishing for highly migratory species such as bluefin tuna provides significant economic benefits to coastal communities through individual angler expenditures, recreational charters, tournaments, and the shoreside businesses that support those activities.",

Barotrauma occurs when the swim bladder of a fish expands as it is quickly brought to the surface. Venting tools help deflate the swim bladder and recompression devices help the fish return to the depth at which it was caught to recompress the air in the swim bladder, preventing serious injury to the fish.In the Gulf of Mexico:Regulations prohibit fishing in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico to protect sensitive fish populations and habitats.Measures are in place to reduce sea turtle bycatch by longline gear and include limiting times or areas where fishermen can fish, gear restrictions, and a limit on the number of vessels that can participate in the reef fish fishery.

        "Biology": "Most sockeye salmon are anadromous—they hatch in freshwater streams and rivers or lakes and generally rear in freshwater lakes for 1 to 3 years, after which they reach the smolt stage and migrate to the ocean to feed and grow.They typically mature and return to fresh water after 2 to 3 years at sea, but some return earlier or stay at sea longer, between 4 and 5 years.Sockeye salmon that return earlier are almost always males and are called \"jacks.\"They typically spawn in the summer or fall.Females select spawning sites, dig nests (redds) with their tails, and deposit eggs (between 2,000 and 4,500) in the redds.Males swim over the redds and fertilize the eggs.Females cover their eggs with gravel using their tails.The eggs hatch during the winter, and the newly hatched salmon (alevins) remain in the gravel, living off the material stored in their yolk sacs until early spring.They then emerge as fry and spend 1 to 3 years in fresh water before reaching the smolt stage and migrating out to the ocean, usually in the spring.All sockeye salmon die within a few weeks after spawning.They sexually mature around the age of 5, which means their lifespan is about 5 years, although some live longer. Age 4 is more common in the Pacific Northwest.While in fresh water, juvenile sockeye salmon feed mainly on zooplankton (tiny floating animals), amphipods (small, shrimp-like crustaceans), and insects.In the ocean, sockeye salmon continue to feed on zooplankton but also eat larval and small adult fishes and occasionally squid.Fish (including other salmon) and birds feed on juvenile salmon.Sharks, lampreys, and marine mammals prey on adult salmon in the ocean. Bears, eagles, and occasionally wolves feed on sockeye salmon in fresh water.After salmon spawn and die, <a href=\"http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=97&amp;issue_id=21\" rel=\"external\">salmon carcasses</a> are a valuable source of energy and nutrients to the river ecosystem.

They want enough salmon to be able to escape the fishery and return to fresh water to spawn and replenish the population.Salmon fishery management largely relies on in-season assessment of how many salmon return to fresh water to spawn.Managers set harvest levels based on these returns. When abundance is high and the number of fish returning is much higher than that needed to meet escapement goals, harvest levels are set higher.During the fishing season, scientists monitor catch and escapement, comparing current returns with those from previous years to keep an eye on abundance and actively manage the fishery.Off the West Coast and in Alaska, the <a href=\"https://www.psc.org/about_treaty.htm\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Salmon Treaty</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.psc.org/\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Salmon Commission</a>, and the <a href=\"https://npafc.org/\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission</a> help coordinate management, research, and enhancement of shared U.S. and international salmon stocks, including sockeye.//",

Sockeye salmon are also harvested off the West Coast, mainly Washington, with a small amount harvested in Oregon.Sockeye salmon remain the preferred species for canning due to the rich orange-red color of their flesh.More than half of the U.S. sockeye salmon catch is sold fresh or frozen rather than canned.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:Primarily harvested commercially in <a href=\"http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/fishing/PDFs/commercial/whatkindofboat_cf.pdf\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">net fisheries</a>, including gillnet purse seines and, more rarely, reef nets.Gillnetters catch salmon by setting curtain-like nets perpendicular to the sockeyes’ trajectory as they migrate along the coast toward fresh water. The mesh openings on the nets are just large enough to allow males (which are usually larger) to get stuck, or gilled, in the mesh.Purse seiners catch salmon by encircling them with a long net and drawing the bottom closed to capture the fish.Sockeye salmon are also caught in commercial troll fisheries for Chinook and coho salmon.Fishing gear used to catch sockeye salmon rarely contacts the ocean floor and has little impact on habitat.Bycatch is low and usually consists of other salmon species.Recreational fishery:Sockeye salmon are a favorite catch of recreational fishermen.To ensure recreational fisheries are sustainable, West Coast anglers are only allowed to keep a certain amount of salmon per fishing trip.In Alaska, regulations vary by area and individual fishery.Recreational fisheries in high-use areas (Cook Inlet, Southeast Alaska, Copper River) are regulated through management plans that allocate fish between commercial and recreational fishermen.Subsistence fishery:Salmon is an important source of spiritual and physical sustenance for Western Indian tribes and Alaska natives, and salmon are culturally important to many other residents of these areas.Subsistence fishermen use a variety of fishing gear to harvest sockeye salmon.",

The relative impact of the pollock fishery on critical salmon runs has been estimated to be relatively low, especially since 2007.100 percent of pollock fishing boats in the Bering Sea carry scientifically trained observers.  They carefully monitor and count all Pacific salmon caught incidentally in the pollock nets. These salmon have never been allowed to be landed or sold by the pollock fishery but, when feasible, they are donated to local Alaska food banks.The <a href=\"https://www.npfmc.org/\">North Pacific Fishery Management Council</a> implemented measures in 2011 to increase incentives for fishermen to further reduce Chinook salmon bycatch.The pollock industry has developed several innovative approaches to meet these new requirements, including using NOAA Fisheries Observer program data to close salmon bycatch hotspots to fishing on a weekly basis and testing a new salmon excluder device for trawl nets.The Council improved the management of Chinook and chum salmon bycatch in the Bering Sea by creating a comprehensive salmon bycatch avoidance program in 2016, and continues to examine additional measures to minimize salmon bycatch.",

Juveniles mostly eat small fish, shrimp, and squid.Adults mainly eat fish, including other monkfish, but also feed on crustaceans, mollusks, seabirds, and diving ducks.Monkfish ambush their prey—they use a modified spine on their head as a fishing pole and bait to lure small fish toward their mouths.When the prey comes near, the monkfish takes a large gulp, which sucks the prey into its mouth and traps it behind rows of back-pointing teeth.Large monkfish have few predators.Predacious fish such as swordfish, sharks, and thorny skate prey on small monkfish.",

Managers and researchers believe that monkfish essential fish habitat is only minimally vulnerable to the effects of bottom trawls and sink gillnet gear.Managers have implemented a variety of measures to protect habitat of other bottom-dwelling fish from any potential impacts from the monkfish fishery:Two areas are closed to monkfish fishing (all gears) year-round to protect sensitive habitat.Fishermen must use gear with specific requirements that prevent them from fishing in sensitive hard bottom areas.Monkfish fisheries sometimes incidentally catch <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-spiny-dogfish\">spiny dogfish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/winter-skate\">skates</a>, which fishermen are allowed to keep as long as they have the appropriate federal permits and comply with the appropriate regulations for these fisheries.There is a limit on the amount of bycatch of other fish species allowed in the monkfish fishery, including possession and landing limits and annual quotas specified in fisheries for those species.Mesh on gillnets and trawl nets must be larger than the established minimum size to reduce bycatch.Gillnets used to target monkfish can incidentally capture protected species, such as sea turtles, <a href=\"http://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/\">large whales (right, humpback, and fin whales)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected/porptrp/\">harbor porpoise</a>, dolphins, and <a href=\"http://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected/atlsturgeon/\">Atlantic sturgeon</a>.Monkfish fishermen follow a number of measures to reduce the fishery’s potential impact on protected species:In the Mid-Atlantic, management measures prohibit gillnet vessels from using large mesh (7 inches or greater) gillnets in some areas during certain times of the year to protect migrating sea turtles.Closures are timed based on projected sea surface temperatures in fishing areas, as sea turtles are known to migrate into these areas when temperatures are about 52 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.The closures move large-mesh gillnetting north in advance of sea turtles migrating into fishing areas and, along with other precautions, have greatly reduced incidental catch of sea turtles in the monkfish fishery.",

NOAA Fisheries and the New England Fishery Management Council collaborate with Canada to jointly manage Georges Bank cod, because the stock spans the international boundary.Atlantic cod, along with other groundfish in New England waters, are managed under the <a href=\"https://www.nefmc.org/management-plans/northeast-multispecies\">Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan</a>, which includes:Permitting requirements for commercial vessels.Separate management measures for recreational vessels.Year-round and seasonal area closures to protect spawning fish and habitat.Minimum fish sizes to prevent harvest of juvenile fish.Annual catch limits, based on best available science.An optional sector (catch share) program can be used for cod and other groundfish species. The sector program allows fishermen to form harvesting cooperatives and work together to decide when, where, and how they harvest fish.A rebuilding plan to rebuild the Gulf of Maine stock to the target population level is in place with a target date of 2024.A rebuilding plan to rebuild the Georges Bank stock to the target population level is in place with a target date of 2027.",

They are commonly harvested by anglers using lures or bait. Fishing occurs year-round.In 2021, recreational anglers landed 750,000 pounds of Atlantic cod, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200:10164932807040::NO:RP::\">recreational fishing landings database</a>.  <a href=\"https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/recfishing/regs/index.html\">Regulations</a> include minimum fish sizes, possession limits, and closed seasons.",

Furthermore, Gloucester was established by a colonial charter issued to profit from cod fishing, and a painted “sacred cod” carved from pine has hung in the Massachusetts state house since 1784 as a symbol of prosperity.Due to high fishing pressure throughout the latter part of the 20th century, there are fewer fish in the U.S. stocks of Atlantic cod than the average for the past four decades.A primary source of rebuilding potential is the number of young fish coming into the population (recruitment). Over the past 20 years, recruitment has varied for the Gulf of Maine stock, and has been well below average for the Georges Bank stock.",
